## FunctionDef generate_color_palette(n)
**Function Overview**: The `generate_color_palette` function generates a list of hexadecimal color codes based on the 'tab20' colormap from Matplotlib.

**Parameters**:
- **n**: An integer representing the number of colors to generate. This parameter determines how many distinct colors will be included in the returned palette.

**Return Values**:
- A list of strings, where each string is a hexadecimal color code (e.g., `'#1f77b4'`).

**Detailed Explanation**:
The `generate_color_palette` function leverages Matplotlib's colormap functionality to generate a specified number of colors. It uses the 'tab20' colormap, which provides 20 distinct colors. The function then converts these colors from RGB format to hexadecimal format using Matplotlib's `rgb2hex` method.

1. **Colormap Selection**: The function starts by selecting the 'tab20' colormap using `plt.get_cmap('tab20')`.
2. **Color Indexing**: It generates a list of indices ranging from 0 to 1, evenly spaced, using `np.linspace(0, 1, n)`. This ensures that the colors are evenly distributed across the colormap.
3. **Color Conversion**: For each index in the generated list, the function retrieves the corresponding color from the colormap and converts it to a hexadecimal string using `mcolors.rgb2hex(cmap(i))`.
4. **Return Statement**: Finally, the function returns a list of these hexadecimal color codes.

**Relationship Description**:
There is no functional relationship to describe as there are no references (callers) or callees within the project that have been provided.

**Usage Notes and Refactoring Suggestions**:
- **Limitations**: The function assumes that the 'tab20' colormap is available, which may not be the case if Matplotlib is not installed or configured correctly.
- **Edge Cases**: If `n` is less than 1, the function will return an empty list. If `n` is greater than 20, it will still only generate 20 colors since 'tab20' has a maximum of 20 distinct colors.
- **Refactoring Opportunities**:
  - **Introduce Explaining Variable**: The expression `np.linspace(0, 1, n)` could be assigned to an explaining variable (e.g., `color_indices`) to improve readability and maintainability.
  - **Encapsulate Collection**: If the function is part of a larger class or module, encapsulating the colormap and conversion logic within a method could enhance modularity.

By following these refactoring suggestions, the code can become more readable and easier to maintain.
