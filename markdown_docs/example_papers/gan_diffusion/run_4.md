## ClassDef SinusoidalEmbedding
**Function Overview**

The `SinusoidalEmbedding` class is a neural network module that generates sinusoidal embeddings from input tensors. These embeddings are used to capture high-frequency patterns and can be particularly useful in models dealing with low-dimensional data.

**Parameters**

- **dim (int)**: The dimension of the embedding space. This parameter determines the number of dimensions in the output tensor.
- **scale (float, optional)**: A scaling factor applied to the input tensor before generating embeddings. Defaults to 1.0 if not provided.

**Return Values**

The method returns a tensor containing sinusoidal embeddings with a shape of `(batch_size, sequence_length, dim)`.

**Detailed Explanation**

The `SinusoidalEmbedding` class inherits from `nn.Module`, making it suitable for use within PyTorch models. The primary function of this class is to generate embeddings that capture high-frequency patterns in the input data. Here's a breakdown of how the method works:

1. **Scaling the Input**: The input tensor `x` is multiplied by the `scale` factor, which can be used to adjust the frequency of the sinusoidal functions.

2. **Generating Embedding Dimensions**:
   - `half_dim = self.dim // 2`: Calculates half of the embedding dimension.
   - `emb = torch.log(torch.Tensor([10000.0])) / (half_dim - 1)`: Computes a base frequency for the sinusoidal functions.
   - `emb = torch.exp(-emb * torch.arange(half_dim)).to(device)`: Generates a set of frequencies by exponentiating and scaling them.

3. **Creating Sinusoidal Embeddings**:
   - `emb = x.unsqueeze(-1) * emb.unsqueeze(0)`: Multiplies the input tensor with the frequency tensor to create embeddings for each dimension.
   - `emb = torch.cat((torch.sin(emb), torch.cos(emb)), dim=-1)`: Concatenates sine and cosine values along the last dimension, effectively doubling the embedding dimensions.

**Relationship Description**

The `SinusoidalEmbedding` class is referenced by the `MLPDenoiser` class within the same file. The `MLPDenoiser` class uses three instances of `SinusoidalEmbedding` for different parts of its architecture:
- `self.time_mlp`: Used for time-related embeddings.
- `self.input_mlp1`: Used for input embeddings with a scale of 25.0.
- `self.input_mlp2`: Also used for input embeddings but with the same scale of 25.0.

**Usage Notes and Refactoring Suggestions**

- **Extract Method**: The frequency calculation within the `forward` method could be extracted into its own method to improve code readability and modularity. This would make the main logic easier to follow.
  
  ```python
  def calculate_frequencies(self, half_dim):
      return torch.exp(-torch.log(torch.Tensor([10000.0])) / (half_dim - 1) * torch.arange(half_dim)).to(device)
  ```

- **Introduce Explaining Variable**: The expression `x.unsqueeze(-1) * emb.unsqueeze(0)` could be assigned to an explaining variable to improve clarity.

  ```python
  scaled_x = x.unsqueeze(-1)
  frequency_tensor = emb.unsqueeze(0)
  embedding = scaled_x * frequency_tensor
  ```

- **Encapsulate Collection**: If the class were to manage more complex operations or collections, encapsulating these within methods could enhance maintainability. However, given the current simplicity of the class, this refactoring is not immediately necessary.

By applying these suggestions, the code can become more readable and easier to maintain while preserving its functionality.
### FunctionDef __init__(self, dim, scale)
### Function Overview

The `__init__` function serves as the constructor for a class that initializes attributes related to sinusoidal embedding with specified dimensions and scale.

### Parameters

- **dim (int)**: An integer representing the dimension of the sinusoidal embedding. This parameter determines the size of the output vector.
  
- **scale (float, optional)**: A floating-point number that scales the input values before applying the sinusoidal transformation. The default value is 1.0.

### Return Values

The function does not return any value; it initializes instance variables within the class.

### Detailed Explanation

The `__init__` method is responsible for setting up a new instance of the class with the specified dimensions (`dim`) and scale (`scale`). It first calls the constructor of its superclass using `super().__init__()`, ensuring that any initialization in parent classes is also performed. Following this, it assigns the provided `dim` and `scale` values to instance variables `self.dim` and `self.scale`, respectively.

### Relationship Description

There are no references (callers) or callees within the project structure provided for this component. Therefore, there is no functional relationship to describe in terms of other parts of the codebase interacting with this initialization method.

### Usage Notes and Refactoring Suggestions

- **Parameter Validation**: The function does not include any validation checks on the `dim` parameter to ensure it is a positive integer or that `scale` is a non-negative number. Adding such validations can prevent potential errors in downstream operations.
  
  ```python
  if not isinstance(dim, int) or dim <= 0:
      raise ValueError("Dimension must be a positive integer.")
  if not isinstance(scale, (int, float)) or scale < 0:
      raise ValueError("Scale must be a non-negative number.")
  ```

- **Encapsulate Collection**: If this class manages any internal collections (not shown in the provided code), consider encapsulating them to prevent direct access and modification from outside the class. This can enhance data integrity and maintainability.

- **Refactoring Techniques**:
  - **Extract Method**: Although the current `__init__` method is concise, if additional initialization logic is added later, extracting this into a separate method could improve readability.
  
  ```python
  def __init__(self, dim: int, scale: float = 1.0):
      super().__init__()
      self._initialize(dim, scale)

  def _initialize(self, dim, scale):
      self.dim = dim
      self.scale = scale
  ```

- **Simplify Conditional Expressions**: If there are conditional checks based on the type or value of `dim` or `scale`, consider using guard clauses to simplify and improve the readability of the code.

By following these suggestions, the code can be made more robust, maintainable, and easier to understand.

### FunctionDef forward(self, x)
**Function Overview**: The `forward` function is responsible for computing sinusoidal embeddings from input tensor `x`, which are commonly used in transformer models to encode positional information.

**Parameters**:
- **x (torch.Tensor)**: A 1D or 2D tensor representing the input data. This tensor will be transformed into a higher-dimensional space using sinusoidal functions.

**Return Values**: The function returns a tensor `emb` of shape `(batch_size, sequence_length, dim)` where each element is a combination of sine and cosine values derived from the input tensor `x`.

**Detailed Explanation**:
1. **Scaling Input**: The input tensor `x` is multiplied by a scale factor stored in `self.scale`. This scaling helps in adjusting the frequency of the sinusoidal embeddings.
2. **Dimension Calculation**: The dimensionality of the embedding space (`self.dim`) is halved to determine `half_dim`.
3. **Exponential Decay Calculation**:
   - A base value of 10,000 is taken and transformed into a logarithmic scale.
   - This value is then divided by `half_dim - 1` to create an exponential decay factor.
4. **Frequency Computation**: The exponential decay factor is used to compute the frequencies for each dimension in the embedding space using `torch.exp`.
5. **Embedding Calculation**:
   - The input tensor `x` is unsqueezed to add a new dimension at the end, making it compatible with the frequency tensor.
   - The frequency tensor is also unsqueezed to add a new dimension at the beginning for broadcasting.
   - The product of these two tensors results in a tensor where each element represents a scaled frequency value based on the input `x`.
6. **Sinusoidal Transformation**:
   - Sine and cosine transformations are applied to the resulting tensor, creating sinusoidal embeddings.
   - These transformations are concatenated along the last dimension to form the final embedding tensor.

**Relationship Description**: The `forward` function is a part of the `SinusoidalEmbedding` class. It does not have any references from other components (`referencer_content`) or references to other components (`reference_letter`). Therefore, there is no functional relationship to describe within the project structure provided.

**Usage Notes and Refactoring Suggestions**:
- **Introduce Explaining Variable**: The calculation of `emb` involves multiple steps that could benefit from introducing explaining variables for clarity. For example, breaking down the frequency computation into separate lines.
- **Extract Method**: If this function becomes more complex or if similar embedding computations are needed elsewhere, consider extracting it into a separate method within the class or even into a utility module to promote code reuse and maintainability.
- **Simplify Conditional Expressions**: Although there are no conditional expressions in this function, maintaining simplicity is crucial. Ensure that any future modifications do not introduce unnecessary complexity.

By following these refactoring suggestions, the code can be made more readable and easier to maintain, enhancing its overall quality and adaptability for future changes.
***
## ClassDef ResidualBlock
### Function Overview

The `ResidualBlock` class is a neural network module designed to implement a residual connection within a feedforward neural network. This block consists of a linear transformation followed by a ReLU activation function and adds the input directly to the output of this sequence.

### Parameters

- **width (int)**: The dimensionality of the input and output tensors processed by the `ResidualBlock`. It determines the number of neurons in the fully connected layer (`nn.Linear`).

### Return Values

The method returns a tensor that is the result of adding the original input tensor to the output of the linear transformation followed by the ReLU activation function.

### Detailed Explanation

The `ResidualBlock` class inherits from `nn.Module`, which is the base class for all neural network modules in PyTorch. The block contains two main components:

1. **Fully Connected Layer (`self.ff`)**: This is a linear layer that takes an input tensor of shape `(batch_size, width)` and outputs a tensor of the same shape. It applies a linear transformation to the input data.

2. **Activation Function (`self.act`)**: A ReLU (Rectified Linear Unit) activation function is applied after the linear transformation. The ReLU function outputs zero for any negative input and the input value itself for positive inputs, introducing non-linearity into the network.

The `forward` method defines how data flows through the block:

- The input tensor `x` is passed through the ReLU activation function.
- The result of this operation is then fed into the fully connected layer (`self.ff`).
- Finally, the original input tensor `x` is added to the output of the linear transformation. This residual connection helps in training very deep networks by allowing gradients to flow more easily during backpropagation.

### Relationship Description

The `ResidualBlock` class is referenced by the `MLPDenoiser` class within the same file (`run_4.py`). Specifically, it is used multiple times within a `nn.Sequential` container as part of the network architecture. This indicates that the `ResidualBlock` serves as a building block for constructing deeper neural networks with residual connections.

### Usage Notes and Refactoring Suggestions

- **Simplify Conditional Expressions**: The current implementation of the `forward` method is straightforward, but if additional logic were to be added (e.g., dropout layers or batch normalization), it might benefit from using guard clauses to improve readability.
  
- **Encapsulate Collection**: If the block were to include more complex operations or collections of parameters, encapsulating these within separate methods could enhance maintainability.

- **Extract Method**: If the logic within the `forward` method grows in complexity, consider extracting parts of it into separate methods. For example, if additional transformations or conditions are added, breaking them down into smaller, focused methods can improve code clarity and make future modifications easier.

Overall, the current implementation of `ResidualBlock` is concise and well-suited for its intended purpose within a residual network architecture. Any further refactoring should be guided by specific needs to enhance readability, maintainability, or performance.
### FunctionDef __init__(self, width)
## Function Overview

The `__init__` function serves as the constructor for a class that initializes a residual block with a fully connected layer (`nn.Linear`) and an activation function (`nn.ReLU`).

## Parameters

- **width**: An integer representing the width of the input and output dimensions for the linear transformation.

## Return Values

This function does not return any value; it initializes the instance variables `ff` and `act`.

## Detailed Explanation

The `__init__` function is responsible for setting up the initial state of an object. It begins by calling the superclass's constructor using `super().__init__()`. This ensures that any initialization defined in the parent class is executed.

Next, it initializes a fully connected layer (`nn.Linear`) named `ff` with input and output dimensions both set to `width`. This layer will perform linear transformations on the input data.

Following this, an activation function (`nn.ReLU`) is initialized and stored in the instance variable `act`. The ReLU (Rectified Linear Unit) activation function introduces non-linearity into the model, allowing it to learn more complex patterns.

## Relationship Description

There are no references provided for either callers or callees within the project. Therefore, there is no functional relationship to describe at this time.

## Usage Notes and Refactoring Suggestions

- **Encapsulate Collection**: If the class using this `__init__` method has other instance variables that could be encapsulated into a collection (e.g., a list of layers), consider refactoring to use an encapsulation technique. This can improve maintainability by centralizing related data.
  
- **Extract Method**: If additional initialization logic is added in the future, consider extracting this logic into separate methods for better modularity and readability.

- **Introduce Explaining Variable**: If the calculation of `width` becomes complex or involves multiple steps, introduce an explaining variable to store intermediate results. This can make the code easier to understand and maintain.

- **Replace Conditional with Polymorphism**: If there are different types of activation functions that need to be used based on certain conditions, consider using polymorphism by defining a base class for activation functions and subclassing it for each type. This approach enhances flexibility and reduces conditional logic in the constructor.
***
### FunctionDef forward(self, x)
**Function Overview**

The `forward` function is a core component of the `ResidualBlock` class within the `run_4.py` module of the `gan_diffusion` project. It implements the forward pass logic for processing input tensors through a residual block architecture.

**Parameters**

- **x**: A PyTorch tensor representing the input data to be processed by the residual block.
  - **referencer_content**: True
  - **reference_letter**: False

**Return Values**

The function returns a PyTorch tensor, which is the result of adding the original input tensor `x` to the output of a feedforward network applied to the activation of `x`.

**Detailed Explanation**

The `forward` function performs the following operations:
1. Applies an activation function (`self.act`) to the input tensor `x`.
2. Passes the activated tensor through a feedforward network (`self.ff`).
3. Adds the original input tensor `x` to the output of the feedforward network.
4. Returns the resulting tensor.

This operation is characteristic of residual blocks, which are commonly used in deep learning architectures to mitigate issues related to vanishing gradients and improve training dynamics by allowing gradient flow through identity mappings.

**Relationship Description**

The `forward` function does not have any callees within the project but is referenced by other components. This indicates that it serves as a processing step within a larger computational graph or model, where its output is used downstream in subsequent layers or operations.

**Usage Notes and Refactoring Suggestions**

- **Introduce Explaining Variable**: The expression `self.ff(self.act(x))` could benefit from an explaining variable to improve readability. For example:
  ```python
  activated_x = self.act(x)
  ff_output = self.ff(activated_x)
  return x + ff_output
  ```
  
- **Encapsulate Collection**: If the feedforward network (`self.ff`) or activation function (`self.act`) are complex and involve multiple operations, consider encapsulating these within their own methods to improve modularity and maintainability.

- **Simplify Conditional Expressions**: Ensure that any conditional logic within `self.act` or `self.ff` is simplified using guard clauses for better readability. However, based on the provided code snippet, there are no explicit conditionals present.

By applying these refactoring suggestions, the code can become more readable and easier to maintain, especially as the complexity of the model grows.
***
## ClassDef MLPDenoiser
**Function Overview**

The `MLPDenoiser` class is a neural network module designed to denoise data by leveraging multi-layer perceptrons (MLP) and sinusoidal embeddings. It processes input data along with time information to produce denoised outputs.

**Parameters**

- **embedding_dim**: An integer representing the dimension of the embedding space used for encoding inputs. Default value is 128.
- **hidden_dim**: An integer specifying the number of neurons in each hidden layer of the MLP network. Default value is 256.
- **hidden_layers**: An integer indicating the number of residual blocks (a type of hidden layer) in the MLP network. Default value is 3.

**Return Values**

The `MLPDenoiser` returns a tensor representing the denoised output, which has a shape of `(batch_size, 2)`.

**Detailed Explanation**

The `MLPDenoiser` class inherits from `nn.Module`, making it a part of PyTorch's neural network module hierarchy. It is designed to process input data and time information through a series of transformations to reduce noise.

1. **Initialization (`__init__` method)**:
   - The constructor initializes three embedding layers: `time_mlp`, `input_mlp1`, and `input_mlp2`. These are instances of the `SinusoidalEmbedding` class, which encodes input data using sinusoidal functions to capture high-frequency patterns.
   - The `network` attribute is a sequential container (`nn.Sequential`) that includes:
     - An initial linear layer transforming concatenated embeddings into a hidden dimension.
     - A series of residual blocks (`ResidualBlock`), each applied multiple times based on the `hidden_layers` parameter.
     - A ReLU activation function to introduce non-linearity.
     - A final linear layer mapping the output back to a two-dimensional space.

2. **Forward Pass (`forward` method)**:
   - The input tensor `x` is split into two components, each processed by its respective embedding layer (`input_mlp1` and `input_mlp2`).
   - The time information `t` is encoded using the `time_mlp` embedding layer.
   - All embeddings are concatenated along the feature dimension.
   - The concatenated tensor is then passed through the `network`, which applies the series of transformations defined during initialization.

**Relationship Description**

The `MLPDenoiser` class does not have any explicit relationships with other components as indicated by the provided references. It stands as an independent module within the project, intended to be used in a broader context where denoising is required.

**Usage Notes and Refactoring Suggestions**

- **Extract Method**: The forward pass logic could benefit from extracting the embedding and concatenation steps into separate methods for better readability and modularity.
  
  ```python
  def _embed_inputs(self, x, t):
      x1_emb = self.input_mlp1(x[:, 0])
      x2_emb = self.input_mlp2(x[:, 1])
      t_emb = self.time_mlp(t)
      return torch.cat([x1_emb, x2_emb, t_emb], dim=-1)
  ```

- **Introduce Explaining Variable**: The concatenated embedding tensor could be assigned to an explaining variable to improve clarity.

  ```python
  def forward(self, x, t):
      emb = self._embed_inputs(x, t)
      return self.network(emb)
  ```

- **Encapsulate Collection**: If the `network` attribute is accessed or modified frequently, encapsulating it within getter and setter methods could improve encapsulation.

These refactoring suggestions aim to enhance the readability, maintainability, and flexibility of the `MLPDenoiser` class.

### FunctionDef forward(self, x, t)
## Function Overview

The `forward` function is responsible for processing input data through a series of neural network layers and returning the final output.

## Parameters

- **x**: A tensor representing the input data. It is expected to have a shape where the second dimension has at least two elements, as it will be sliced into `x[:, 0]` and `x[:, 1]`.
- **t**: A tensor representing time-related information that influences the output.

## Return Values

The function returns a tensor processed through a neural network, which is the final output of the model.

## Detailed Explanation

The `forward` function processes input data through several steps:

1. **Embedding Generation**:
   - The first element of the input tensor `x` (`x[:, 0]`) is passed through `input_mlp1`, generating an embedding `x1_emb`.
   - The second element of the input tensor `x` (`x[:, 1]`) is passed through `input_mlp2`, generating another embedding `x2_emb`.
   - The time-related information tensor `t` is passed through `time_mlp`, generating a time embedding `t_emb`.

2. **Concatenation**:
   - The embeddings `x1_emb`, `x2_emb`, and `t_emb` are concatenated along the last dimension to form a single tensor `emb`.

3. **Final Processing**:
   - The concatenated tensor `emb` is passed through `network`, which likely represents a neural network layer or series of layers, producing the final output.

## Relationship Description

There is no functional relationship described based on the provided information. This function does not have any references from other components within the project (`referencer_content`) nor does it reference any other parts of the project (`reference_letter`).

## Usage Notes and Refactoring Suggestions

- **Extract Method**: The embedding generation steps for `x1_emb`, `x2_emb`, and `t_emb` could be extracted into separate methods. This would improve readability and make the code more modular.
  
  ```python
  def _generate_x1_embedding(self, x):
      return self.input_mlp1(x[:, 0])

  def _generate_x2_embedding(self, x):
      return self.input_mlp2(x[:, 1])

  def _generate_time_embedding(self, t):
      return self.time_mlp(t)
  ```

- **Introduce Explaining Variable**: The concatenated tensor `emb` could be assigned to an explaining variable with a descriptive name to improve clarity.

  combined_embeddings = torch.cat([x1_emb, x2_emb, t_emb], dim=-1)
  return self.network(combined_embeddings)
  ```

- **Simplify Conditional Expressions**: If there are any conditional checks within the `forward` function (not shown in the provided code), consider using guard clauses to simplify and improve readability.

By applying these refactoring suggestions, the code can become more readable, maintainable, and easier to understand.
***
## ClassDef NoiseScheduler
### Function Overview

The `NoiseScheduler` class is designed to manage noise scheduling parameters and operations for generative adversarial networks (GANs) using diffusion models. It calculates various parameters related to noise levels across a specified number of timesteps and provides methods to add noise to data, reconstruct original samples from noisy data, and compute posterior distributions.

### Parameters

- **num_timesteps**: The total number of timesteps for the noise schedule. Default is 1000.
- **beta_start**: The starting value of the beta parameter in the noise schedule. Default is 0.0001.
- **beta_end**: The ending value of the beta parameter in the noise schedule. Default is 0.02.
- **beta_schedule**: The type of schedule for the beta values, either "linear" or "quadratic". Default is "linear".

### Return Values

- None: The constructor initializes internal attributes and does not return any value.

### Detailed Explanation

The `NoiseScheduler` class initializes several key parameters based on the noise schedule:

1. **Beta Calculation**: Depending on the specified beta schedule ("linear" or "quadratic"), it calculates a sequence of beta values using PyTorch's `linspace` for linear and custom calculations for quadratic.
2. **Alpha Values**: Computes alpha values as 1 minus the betas.
3. **Cumulative Alpha Products**: Calculates cumulative products of alphas, which are essential for various noise-related computations.
4. **Square Root Calculations**: Derives square roots of cumulative alpha products and related terms needed for adding noise and reconstructing samples.

The class provides several methods:

- **reconstruct_x0**: Reconstructs the original sample from noisy data using precomputed coefficients.
- **q_posterior**: Computes the mean of the posterior distribution over latent variables given noisy observations.
- **get_variance**: Retrieves the variance at a specific timestep, ensuring it does not fall below a small threshold to prevent numerical instability.
- **step**: Performs one step in the diffusion process by reconstructing the original sample and adding noise based on the current timestep.
- **add_noise**: Adds noise to an initial sample using precomputed coefficients for different timesteps.

### Relationship Description

The `NoiseScheduler` class is a core component within the GAN diffusion model, acting as a central manager of noise parameters. It does not have any explicit references from other components in the provided code snippet (`referencer_content` and `reference_letter` are both falsy). However, it is likely that this class is called by various parts of the GAN training loop to manage noise addition and reconstruction processes.

### Usage Notes and Refactoring Suggestions

- **Encapsulate Collection**: The internal collections such as beta values and alpha products could be encapsulated within their own methods or properties to improve modularity.
- **Introduce Explaining Variable**: Complex expressions, especially in the constructor, can benefit from introducing explaining variables for clarity.
- **Replace Conditional with Polymorphism**: If additional noise schedules are introduced in the future, consider using polymorphism to handle different scheduling types instead of multiple conditional statements.

By applying these refactoring techniques, the code can become more maintainable and easier to extend.
### FunctionDef __init__(self, num_timesteps, beta_start, beta_end, beta_schedule)
### Function Overview

The `__init__` function initializes a `NoiseScheduler` object with parameters defining the number of timesteps and the schedule for beta values. It calculates various alpha and cumulative products required for noise scheduling operations in generative models.

### Parameters

- **num_timesteps**: An integer representing the total number of timesteps for the diffusion process. Defaults to 1000.
- **beta_start**: A float indicating the starting value of the beta schedule, which controls the variance of the noise added at each timestep. Defaults to 0.0001.
- **beta_end**: A float representing the ending value of the beta schedule. Defaults to 0.02.
- **beta_schedule**: A string specifying the type of schedule for beta values. It can be either "linear" or "quadratic". Defaults to "linear".

### Return Values

The function does not return any values; it initializes instance variables within the `NoiseScheduler` object.

### Detailed Explanation

The `__init__` method sets up a noise scheduler by calculating various parameters based on the provided beta schedule. The primary steps are:

1. **Beta Calculation**:
   - If the `beta_schedule` is "linear", it calculates a linearly spaced sequence of betas from `beta_start` to `beta_end`.
   - If the `beta_schedule` is "quadratic", it calculates a quadratic sequence by first taking the square root of the linearly spaced values between `beta_start ** 0.5` and `beta_end ** 0.5`, then squaring them.
   - Raises a `ValueError` if an unknown schedule type is provided.

2. **Alpha Calculation**:
   - Computes alphas as `1.0 - betas`.

3. **Cumulative Products**:
   - Calculates cumulative products of alphas (`alphas_cumprod`) and pads the previous cumulative product with a value of 1 at the beginning (`alphas_cumprod_prev`).

4. **Square Roots**:
   - Computes square roots of cumulative products for noise addition (`sqrt_alphas_cumprod`, `sqrt_one_minus_alphas_cumprod`).
   - Calculates inverse square roots for reconstructing x0 (`sqrt_inv_alphas_cumprod`, `sqrt_inv_alphas_cumprod_minus_one`).

5. **Posterior Mean Coefficients**:
   - Computes coefficients required for the posterior mean calculation in the diffusion process (`posterior_mean_coef1`, `posterior_mean_coef2`).

### Relationship Description

The `__init__` method is called when a new instance of `NoiseScheduler` is created, typically by other components within the project that require noise scheduling functionality. It does not call any external functions or methods; it only initializes internal state based on input parameters.

### Usage Notes and Refactoring Suggestions

- **Extract Method**: The beta calculation logic could be extracted into a separate method to improve readability and modularity.
  
  ```python
  def calculate_betas(self, num_timesteps, beta_start, beta_end, beta_schedule):
      if beta_schedule == "linear":
          return torch.linspace(beta_start, beta_end, num_timesteps, dtype=torch.float32).to(device)
      elif beta_schedule == "quadratic":
          return (torch.linspace(beta_start ** 0.5, beta_end ** 0.5, num_timesteps, dtype=torch.float32) ** 2).to(device)
      else:
          raise ValueError(f"Unknown beta schedule: {beta_schedule}")
  ```

- **Introduce Explaining Variable**: Introducing variables for intermediate calculations like `sqrt_alphas_cumprod` and `sqrt_one_minus_alphas_cumprod` can improve clarity.

- **Simplify Conditional Expressions**: The conditional check for `beta_schedule` could be simplified by using guard clauses to handle unknown schedules early in the method.

  ```python
  if beta_schedule not in ["linear", "quadratic"]:
      raise ValueError(f"Unknown beta schedule: {beta_schedule}")
  ```

By applying these refactoring techniques, the code can become more readable and maintainable, making it easier to understand and modify in the future.

### FunctionDef reconstruct_x0(self, x_t, t, noise)
---

## Function Overview

The `reconstruct_x0` function is responsible for reconstructing the original sample \( x_0 \) from a given noisy sample \( x_t \) and noise at a specific timestep \( t \).

## Parameters

- **x_t**: A tensor representing the noisy sample at time step \( t \).
- **t**: An integer representing the current timestep.
- **noise**: A tensor representing the noise added to the original sample.

## Return Values

The function returns a tensor representing the reconstructed original sample \( x_0 \).

## Detailed Explanation

The `reconstruct_x0` function uses precomputed values from attributes of the class instance (`sqrt_inv_alphas_cumprod` and `sqrt_inv_alphas_cumprod_minus_one`) to reconstruct the original sample \( x_0 \) from a noisy sample \( x_t \) and noise. The logic involves:

1. **Extracting Precomputed Values**: 
   - `s1` is derived from `self.sqrt_inv_alphas_cumprod[t]`.
   - `s2` is derived from `self.sqrt_inv_alphas_cumprod_minus_one[t]`.

2. **Reshaping**:
   - Both `s1` and `s2` are reshaped to have a shape of \((-1, 1)\) to ensure compatibility with the dimensions of `x_t` and `noise`.

3. **Reconstruction Calculation**:
   - The original sample \( x_0 \) is reconstructed using the formula: 
     \[
     s1 * x_t - s2 * noise
     \]
   - This formula leverages the precomputed scaling factors to reverse the diffusion process applied to the original sample.

## Relationship Description

The `reconstruct_x0` function is called by the `step` method within the same class (`NoiseScheduler`). The relationship can be described as follows:

- **Caller**: The `step` method calls `reconstruct_x0` to obtain the reconstructed original sample \( x_0 \) at each timestep.
- **Callee**: The `reconstruct_x0` function is called by the `step` method, which then uses this reconstructed sample in further calculations.

## Usage Notes and Refactoring Suggestions

### Limitations
- The function assumes that `sqrt_inv_alphas_cumprod` and `sqrt_inv_alphas_cumprod_minus_one` are precomputed and available as attributes of the class instance. If these values are not correctly initialized, the function will raise an error.
  
### Edge Cases
- If `t` is out of bounds for the precomputed arrays (`sqrt_inv_alphas_cumprod` or `sqrt_inv_alphas_cumprod_minus_one`), the function may raise an index error.

### Refactoring Opportunities

1. **Introduce Explaining Variable**:
   - The reshaping operation can be extracted into a separate variable to improve clarity.
     ```python
     s1 = self.sqrt_inv_alphas_cumprod[t].reshape(-1, 1)
     s2 = self.sqrt_inv_alphas_cumprod_minus_one[t].reshape(-1, 1)
     ```

2. **Encapsulate Collection**:
   - If the precomputed arrays (`sqrt_inv_alphas_cumprod` and `sqrt_inv_alphas_cumprod_minus_one`) are accessed frequently or modified, consider encapsulating them within a separate class to manage their state and provide methods for accessing these values.

3. **Simplify Conditional Expressions**:
   - Although there are no conditional expressions in this function, ensuring that the precomputed arrays are always correctly initialized can prevent potential errors.

By applying these refactoring suggestions, the code can become more readable, maintainable, and robust against future changes.

### FunctionDef q_posterior(self, x_0, x_t, t)
## Function Overview

The `q_posterior` function calculates the posterior mean given initial sample \( x_0 \), current noisy sample \( x_t \), and time step \( t \).

## Parameters

- **x_0**: The initial clean sample at time 0. This is a tensor representing the original data before any noise was added.
  
- **x_t**: The current noisy sample at time \( t \). This tensor represents the data after noise has been applied up to the specified time step.

- **t**: The current time step in the diffusion process. This indicates how much noise has been added to the initial sample.

## Return Values

The function returns `mu`, which is the calculated posterior mean of the clean sample \( x_0 \) given the noisy sample \( x_t \) and the time step \( t \).

## Detailed Explanation

The `q_posterior` function computes the posterior mean using coefficients derived from the noise schedule. The logic follows these steps:

1. **Retrieve Coefficients**: The function accesses two coefficients, `posterior_mean_coef1[t]` and `posterior_mean_coef2[t]`, which are specific to the current time step \( t \). These coefficients are reshaped to ensure they can be broadcasted correctly during multiplication.

2. **Compute Posterior Mean**: The posterior mean \( \mu \) is calculated using the formula:
   \[
   \mu = s1 \times x_0 + s2 \times x_t
   \]
   where `s1` and `s2` are the reshaped coefficients from step 1.

3. **Return Result**: The computed posterior mean \( \mu \) is returned as the output of the function.

## Relationship Description

The `q_posterior` function is called by the `step` method within the same class, `NoiseScheduler`. This indicates a caller-callee relationship where `q_posterior` serves as a helper function to compute the posterior mean required for the diffusion process step.

## Usage Notes and Refactoring Suggestions

- **Simplify Conditional Expressions**: The function does not contain any conditional logic that could be simplified using guard clauses. However, if additional conditions are added in the future, it would be beneficial to use guard clauses to improve readability.
  
- **Introduce Explaining Variable**: The reshaping of coefficients `s1` and `s2` is a simple operation but could benefit from an explaining variable to clarify the purpose of this transformation. For example:
  ```python
  s1_reshaped = self.posterior_mean_coef1[t].reshape(-1, 1)
  s2_reshaped = self.posterior_mean_coef2[t].reshape(-1, 1)
  mu = s1_reshaped * x_0 + s2_reshaped * x_t
  ```
  
- **Encapsulate Collection**: If the coefficients `posterior_mean_coef1` and `posterior_mean_coef2` are accessed frequently or manipulated in other methods, encapsulating them within a class could improve modularity and maintainability.

Overall, the function is straightforward and well-defined. The suggested refactoring techniques would enhance readability and maintainability without altering its core functionality.
***
### FunctionDef get_variance(self, t)
---

**Function Overview**

The `get_variance` function calculates the variance at a given timestep `t` using parameters derived from the `NoiseScheduler` class. This variance is crucial for controlling the noise level during diffusion processes in generative models.

**Parameters**

- **t**: An integer representing the current timestep. It determines the point in the diffusion process where the variance calculation is performed.
  - **referencer_content**: True
  - **reference_letter**: False

**Return Values**

- The function returns a single float value representing the calculated variance at the specified timestep `t`.

**Detailed Explanation**

The `get_variance` function computes the variance based on the following logic:

1. If the timestep `t` is 0, the function immediately returns 0, as no variance is needed at the initial step of the diffusion process.
2. For other timesteps:
   - The variance is calculated using the formula:
     \[
     \text{variance} = \beta_t \times \frac{(1 - \alpha_{\text{cumprod}}[t-1])}{(1 - \alpha_{\text{cumprod}}[t])}
     \]
   - Here, `\(\beta_t\)` represents the noise schedule at timestep `t`, and `\(\alpha_{\text{cumprod}}\)[]` denotes the cumulative product of alpha values up to a given timestep.
3. The calculated variance is then clipped to ensure it does not fall below \(1 \times 10^{-20}\) to prevent numerical instability during computations.

**Relationship Description**

- **Callers**: The `get_variance` function is called by the `step` method within the same `NoiseScheduler` class.
  - In the `step` method, `get_variance(t)` is invoked when `t > 0`. This variance value is then used to generate noise and adjust the predicted previous sample in the diffusion process.

**Usage Notes and Refactoring Suggestions**

- **Edge Cases**: The function assumes that the input timestep `t` is within the valid range of the diffusion schedule. If `t` exceeds the predefined range, it may lead to index errors or incorrect variance calculations.
  - **Refactoring Opportunity**: Introduce boundary checks for the timestep `t` to ensure it falls within the valid range before proceeding with variance calculation. This can prevent potential runtime errors and improve robustness.

- **Code Readability**:
  - The formula used in the variance calculation is concise but might be difficult to understand at first glance.
    - **Refactoring Technique**: Introduce an explaining variable for the complex expression inside the `get_variance` function. For example:
      ```python
      alpha_cumprod_prev_t = self.alphas_cumprod_prev[t]
      alpha_cumprod_t = self.alphas_cumprod[t]
      variance_factor = (1. - alpha_cumprod_prev_t) / (1. - alpha_cumprod_t)
      variance = self.betas[t] * variance_factor
      ```
    - This refactoring improves readability by breaking down the calculation into more understandable steps.

- **Potential for Further Refactoring**:
  - If similar calculations are performed in other parts of the code, consider encapsulating these operations within a separate method to promote code reuse and maintainability.
  - **Refactoring Technique**: Encapsulate Collection if there is a need to manage or modify the noise schedule parameters (`betas`, `alphas_cumprod`, etc.) more flexibly.

**Conclusion**

The `get_variance` function plays a critical role in managing the diffusion process by calculating variance at each timestep. By ensuring that the variance is correctly computed and clipped, it maintains numerical stability and contributes to the effectiveness of generative models. The suggested refactoring techniques can enhance the code's readability and maintainability while preserving its functionality.

### FunctionDef add_noise(self, x_start, x_noise, timesteps)
### Function Overview

The `add_noise` function is designed to add noise to a starting signal (`x_start`) based on a specified schedule defined by cumulative product terms related to alpha values and timesteps.

### Parameters

- **x_start**: The initial signal or data array from which noise will be added. It is expected to be a multi-dimensional array where the first dimension represents different samples.
  
- **x_noise**: The noise signal that will be added to `x_start`. This should also be a multi-dimensional array with the same shape as `x_start`.
  
- **timesteps**: An integer or an array of integers representing the timesteps at which the noise addition is scheduled. These values are used to index into precomputed arrays (`sqrt_alphas_cumprod` and `sqrt_one_minus_alphas_cumprod`) that determine the scaling factors for the noise addition.

### Return Values

The function returns a new array where the original signal (`x_start`) has been mixed with noise (`x_noise`). The mixing is controlled by the cumulative product terms at the specified timesteps, resulting in a noisy version of the input signal.

### Detailed Explanation

1. **Parameter Retrieval**: The function uses the `timesteps` parameter to index into two precomputed arrays:
   - `self.sqrt_alphas_cumprod[timesteps]`: This array contains the square root of cumulative product terms related to alpha values, which are used to scale the original signal.
   - `self.sqrt_one_minus_alphas_cumprod[timesteps]`: This array contains the square root of cumulative product terms related to one minus alpha values, used to scale the noise.

2. **Reshaping**: Both scaling factors (`s1` and `s2`) are reshaped to ensure they can be broadcasted across the dimensions of `x_start` and `x_noise`. This is typically done by adding a new axis (using `.reshape(-1, 1)`) to make them compatible for element-wise multiplication.

3. **Noise Addition**: The function computes the noisy signal by multiplying `s1` with `x_start` and `s2` with `x_noise`, then summing these two products. This operation effectively blends the original signal with noise according to the specified schedule.

### Relationship Description

- **referencer_content**: There are references (callers) from other components within the project that use this function to add noise to signals.
  
- **reference_letter**: This component is called by other parts of the project, indicating it serves as a callee in the relationship.

The `add_noise` function plays a crucial role in the noise addition process within the GAN diffusion model. It is invoked by various components that require noisy versions of input data at specific timesteps to simulate diffusion processes.

### Usage Notes and Refactoring Suggestions

- **Introduce Explaining Variable**: The computation of `s1` and `s2` involves complex expressions that could be simplified by introducing explaining variables. For example:
  ```python
  alpha_scale = self.sqrt_alphas_cumprod[timesteps].reshape(-1, 1)
  noise_scale = self.sqrt_one_minus_alphas_cumprod[timesteps].reshape(-1, 1)
  noisy_signal = alpha_scale * x_start + noise_scale * x_noise
  ```
  This refactoring improves readability by breaking down the computation into more manageable parts.

- **Encapsulate Collection**: If `sqrt_alphas_cumprod` and `sqrt_one_minus_alphas_cumprod` are accessed frequently, consider encapsulating them within a class or method to reduce direct exposure of these internal collections. This can improve encapsulation and make the code easier to maintain.

- **Simplify Conditional Expressions**: Although there are no explicit conditional expressions in this function, ensure that any future modifications do not introduce unnecessary complexity. Use guard clauses if additional conditions are added to handle edge cases more clearly.

By applying these refactoring suggestions, the `add_noise` function can be made more readable and maintainable, enhancing its integration within the broader project structure.

### FunctionDef __len__(self)
### Function Overview

The `__len__` function is designed to return the number of timesteps associated with a NoiseScheduler instance.

### Parameters

- **referencer_content**: This parameter indicates if there are references (callers) from other components within the project to this component. In this case, it is not provided.
  
- **reference_letter**: This parameter shows if there is a reference to this component from other project parts, representing callees in the relationship. It is also not provided.

### Return Values

The function returns an integer value representing the number of timesteps (`self.num_timesteps`).

### Detailed Explanation

The `__len__` function is a special method in Python that allows an instance to be used with the built-in `len()` function. In this context, it provides the length of the NoiseScheduler by returning the value stored in `self.num_timesteps`. This method does not take any parameters other than `self`, which refers to the instance of the class.

### Relationship Description

Since neither `referencer_content` nor `reference_letter` is provided, there is no functional relationship to describe regarding callers or callees within the project. The function operates independently based on its internal state (`self.num_timesteps`).

### Usage Notes and Refactoring Suggestions

- **Limitations**: The function assumes that `self.num_timesteps` is always set and is an integer. If this assumption is not met, it could lead to errors or unexpected behavior.
  
- **Edge Cases**: 
  - If `self.num_timesteps` is negative, the length returned by `__len__` will also be negative, which might not be meaningful in some contexts.
  - If `self.num_timesteps` is zero, the length of the NoiseScheduler would be reported as zero.

- **Refactoring Opportunities**:
  - **Encapsulate Collection**: Although this function does not directly expose a collection, if there are other methods that manipulate or access `num_timesteps`, encapsulating it within getter and setter methods could improve control over its value.
  
  - **Introduce Explaining Variable**: If the logic for determining `self.num_timesteps` becomes more complex in the future, introducing an explaining variable to store intermediate results could enhance readability.

- **General Suggestions**:
  - Ensure that `num_timesteps` is always initialized properly when a NoiseScheduler instance is created.
  - Consider adding validation checks within the setter method of `num_timesteps` (if implemented) to ensure it remains non-negative and reasonable for the context in which the NoiseScheduler is used.
