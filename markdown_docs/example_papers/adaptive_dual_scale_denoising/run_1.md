### FunctionDef __init__(self, dim, scale)
### Function Overview

The `__init__` function is the constructor method for the `SinusoidalEmbedding` class. It initializes the instance with a specified dimension (`dim`) and an optional scaling factor (`scale`).

### Parameters

- **dim**: An integer representing the dimension of the embedding space.
- **scale**: A float representing the scaling factor applied to the embedding, with a default value of 1.0.

### Return Values

- The function does not return any values; it initializes instance variables within the class.

### Detailed Explanation

The `__init__` method is responsible for setting up the initial state of an instance of the `SinusoidalEmbedding` class. It takes two parameters: `dim`, which specifies the dimensionality of the embedding, and `scale`, which provides a scaling factor applied to the embedding process.

1. **Initialization**: The method begins by calling the constructor of the superclass using `super().__init__()`. This ensures that any initialization logic in the parent class is executed.
2. **Setting Dimensions**: The instance variable `self.dim` is set to the value of `dim`, which defines the dimensionality of the embedding space.
3. **Setting Scale**: The instance variable `self.scale` is set to the value of `scale`. If no scale is provided during instantiation, it defaults to 1.0.

### Relationship Description

There are no references or indications of either callers (`referencer_content`) or callees (`reference_letter`). Therefore, there is no functional relationship within the project structure to describe regarding this component.

### Usage Notes and Refactoring Suggestions

- **Parameter Validation**: Consider adding input validation for `dim` to ensure it is a positive integer. This would prevent potential errors in downstream operations that rely on valid dimensions.
  
  ```python
  if not isinstance(dim, int) or dim <= 0:
      raise ValueError("Dimension must be a positive integer")
  ```

- **Documentation**: Adding type hints and docstrings to the parameters can improve code readability and maintainability.

  ```python
  def __init__(self, dim: int, scale: float = 1.0) -> None:
      """
      Initialize the SinusoidalEmbedding with a specified dimension and scale.
      
      :param dim: The dimension of the embedding space.
      :param scale: An optional scaling factor for the embedding.
      """
      super().__init__()
      self.dim = dim
      self.scale = scale
  ```

- **Encapsulate Collection**: If there are any internal collections or complex data structures within the class, consider encapsulating them to prevent direct access and modification from outside the class.

By implementing these suggestions, the code can become more robust, maintainable, and easier to understand for other developers working on the project.

### FunctionDef forward(self, x)
### Function Overview

The `forward` function is responsible for generating sinusoidal embeddings from input tensor `x`, scaling it by a predefined factor, and then computing positional encodings using sine and cosine functions.

### Parameters

- **x**: A torch.Tensor representing the input data to be embedded. This tensor is expected to have a shape that can be processed by the embedding logic within the function.

### Return Values

The function returns a torch.Tensor containing the sinusoidal embeddings, which has a shape derived from the input tensor `x` and the embedding dimensionality defined within the class.

### Detailed Explanation

1. **Scaling Input Tensor**: The input tensor `x` is multiplied by a scaling factor stored in `self.scale`. This step adjusts the magnitude of the input data according to the specified scale.

2. **Embedding Dimension Calculation**: The variable `half_dim` is calculated as half of the embedding dimension (`self.dim`). This value is used to determine the number of dimensions for which sinusoidal embeddings will be computed.

3. **Exponential Decay Calculation**:
   - A tensor containing a single element, 10000.0, is converted to a logarithmic scale.
   - This log value is then divided by `half_dim - 1` to create an exponential decay factor.
   - The decay factor is used to compute the base for the exponentiation in the next step.

4. **Exponentiation and Device Placement**:
   - An exponential decay series is generated using `torch.exp(-emb * torch.arange(half_dim))`.
   - This tensor is then moved to the same device as the input tensor `x` for compatibility during subsequent operations.

5. **Broadcasting and Multiplication**:
   - The input tensor `x` is unsqueezed to add a new dimension at the end.
   - The exponential decay series is also unsqueezed to add a new dimension at the beginning.
   - These two tensors are multiplied together, resulting in a tensor where each element of `x` has been scaled by the corresponding value from the exponential decay series.

6. **Sinusoidal Embedding Calculation**:
   - The broadcasted and multiplied tensor is passed through sine and cosine functions to generate sinusoidal embeddings.
   - These embeddings are concatenated along the last dimension, resulting in a final tensor that contains both sine and cosine components for each input element.

### Relationship Description

The `forward` function does not have any explicit references from other components within the project (`referencer_content` is falsy). Similarly, there are no indications of this function being called by other parts of the project (`reference_letter` is also falsy). Therefore, there is no functional relationship to describe in terms of callers or callees.

### Usage Notes and Refactoring Suggestions

- **Introduce Explaining Variable**: The calculation for `emb` involves a complex expression that could be broken down into smaller steps using explaining variables. For example:
  ```python
  log_base = torch.log(torch.Tensor([10000.0]))
  decay_factor = log_base / (half_dim - 1)
  exp_series = torch.exp(-decay_factor * torch.arange(half_dim)).to(device)
  ```
- **Encapsulate Collection**: The exponential decay series calculation could be encapsulated into a separate method to improve modularity and readability.
- **Simplify Conditional Expressions**: If there are any conditional checks within the class that determine the behavior of `forward`, consider using guard clauses to simplify the logic flow.

By applying these refactoring suggestions, the code can become more readable, maintainable, and easier to extend in future developments.

### FunctionDef __init__(self, width)
### Function Overview

The `__init__` function is responsible for initializing a new instance of the `ResidualBlock` class. It sets up the necessary components, including a linear transformation layer and an activation function.

### Parameters

- **width**: An integer representing the number of input and output features for the linear transformation layer (`nn.Linear`). This parameter determines the dimensionality of the data processed by the block.

### Return Values

The `__init__` function does not return any values; it initializes the instance variables within the class.

### Detailed Explanation

The `__init__` function performs the following steps:

1. **Inheritance Initialization**: Calls the parent class's `__init__` method using `super().__init__()`. This ensures that any initialization logic defined in the parent class is executed.
2. **Linear Transformation Layer**: Initializes a linear transformation layer (`nn.Linear`) with input and output dimensions both set to `width`. This layer will perform a matrix multiplication on the input data, scaling it according to the specified width.
3. **Activation Function**: Initializes a ReLU activation function (`nn.ReLU`). This non-linear activation function introduces non-linearity into the model, allowing it to learn more complex patterns.

### Relationship Description

There is no functional relationship described based on the provided information. The `__init__` method does not have any references from other components within the project (no `referencer_content`), nor does it reference any other parts of the project (no `reference_letter`). Therefore, there are no callers or callees to describe in this context.

### Usage Notes and Refactoring Suggestions

- **Parameter Validation**: Consider adding input validation for the `width` parameter to ensure that it is a positive integer. This can prevent potential errors during initialization.
  
  ```python
  if not isinstance(width, int) or width <= 0:
      raise ValueError("Width must be a positive integer.")
  ```

- **Encapsulate Collection**: If there are additional layers or components that need to be initialized in the future, consider encapsulating these within a list or dictionary. This can make it easier to manage and extend the block's functionality.

  ```python
  self.layers = nn.ModuleList([self.ff, self.act])
  ```

- **Extract Method**: If more initialization logic is added in the future, consider extracting this into separate methods for better modularity and readability.

  ```python
  def __init__(self, width: int):
      super().__init__()
      self._initialize_layers(width)

  def _initialize_layers(self, width: int):
      self.ff = nn.Linear(width, width)
      self.act = nn.ReLU()
  ```

By following these suggestions, the code can be made more robust and easier to maintain.

### FunctionDef forward(self, x)
### Function Overview

The `forward` function is a core component of the `ResidualBlock` class within the `run_1.py` module. This function defines the forward pass logic for the residual block, which involves applying an activation function followed by a feed-forward operation and then adding the result to the input tensor.

### Parameters

- **x**: A PyTorch tensor representing the input data that will be processed through the residual block.
  - **Type**: `torch.Tensor`
  - **Description**: The input tensor is expected to have dimensions compatible with the operations defined within the function, such as being passed through an activation function and a feed-forward network.

### Return Values

- **Type**: `torch.Tensor`
- **Description**: The output tensor resulting from the forward pass of the residual block. This tensor is the sum of the input tensor `x` and the result of applying the activation function followed by the feed-forward operation (`self.ff(self.act(x))`).

### Detailed Explanation

The `forward` function implements a typical residual connection pattern in neural network architectures, commonly used to facilitate deeper networks by allowing gradients to flow more easily during training. The logic within the function can be broken down as follows:

1. **Activation Function Application**: The input tensor `x` is passed through an activation function (`self.act(x)`). This step introduces non-linearity into the model, enabling it to learn complex patterns in the data.

2. **Feed-Forward Operation**: The result of the activation function is then processed by a feed-forward network (`self.ff`). This typically involves linear transformations (e.g., matrix multiplications) followed by another activation or other operations defined within `self.ff`.

3. **Residual Connection**: Finally, the output of the feed-forward operation is added to the original input tensor `x` (`x + self.ff(self.act(x))`). This residual connection allows the network to learn identity mappings, which can help in training deeper networks by mitigating issues like vanishing gradients.

### Relationship Description

- **Referencer Content**: The `forward` function is called within the broader context of a neural network model that utilizes residual blocks. It serves as a fundamental building block for constructing more complex architectures.
  
- **Reference Letter**: This function does not reference any other components directly; it is referenced by higher-level components or models that integrate residual blocks into their design.

### Usage Notes and Refactoring Suggestions

- **Complexity**: The `forward` function is relatively simple, but its role in enabling deeper networks through residual connections is crucial. Ensuring that the activation function (`self.act`) and feed-forward network (`self.ff`) are correctly configured is essential for optimal performance.
  
- **Refactoring Opportunities**:
  - **Introduce Explaining Variable**: If `self.act(x)` or `self.ff(self.act(x))` becomes complex, consider introducing an explaining variable to store intermediate results. This can improve code readability and maintainability.
  - **Encapsulate Collection**: Ensure that any internal collections used within `self.act` or `self.ff` are properly encapsulated to prevent unintended modifications from external components.

By adhering to these guidelines, the `forward` function remains a clear and effective component of the residual block, contributing to the overall robustness and performance of the neural network architecture.

## ClassDef MLPDenoiser
# Function Overview

The `MLPDenoiser` class is a neural network module designed for denoising tasks using a multi-layer perceptron (MLP) architecture with both global and local branches. It processes input data through sinusoidal embeddings, residual blocks, and combines outputs from different scales to produce denoised results.

# Parameters

- **embedding_dim**: An integer representing the dimension of the embedding space used in the model. Default is 128.
- **hidden_dim**: An integer specifying the number of neurons in each hidden layer of the MLPs. Default is 256.
- **hidden_layers**: An integer indicating the number of residual blocks in the global and local networks. Default is 3.

# Detailed Explanation

The `MLPDenoiser` class inherits from `nn.Module` and implements a denoising model using two parallel branches: a global branch and a local branch. The model is designed to handle input data with two components, each processed through separate sinusoidal embeddings (`input_mlp1` and `input_mlp2`) and combined with a time embedding (`time_mlp`). Here’s the detailed breakdown of the logic:

1. **Embedding Layers**:
   - `input_mlp1` and `input_mlp2`: These layers apply sinusoidal transformations to the first and second components of the input data, respectively.
   - `time_mlp`: This layer applies a sinusoidal transformation to the time step (`t`) data.

2. **Global Network**:
   - The global network processes the concatenated embeddings from both input components and the time step.
   - It consists of a linear layer followed by multiple residual blocks, a ReLU activation function, and another linear layer that outputs two values.

3. **Local Network**:
   - The local network operates on upscaled versions of the input data.
   - Similar to the global network, it processes the concatenated embeddings from both input components and the time step through a series of layers.

4. **Weighting Mechanism**:
   - A weight network is used to dynamically determine the contribution of the global and local outputs based on the time step.
   - The weight network consists of linear layers followed by ReLU activation and a sigmoid function to ensure the output is between 0 and 1.

5. **Output Combination**:
   - The final output is computed as a weighted sum of the global and local outputs, where the weights are determined by the weight network.

# Relationship Description

The `MLPDenoiser` class does not have any explicit references or referencers within the provided project structure. Therefore, there is no functional relationship to describe in terms of callers or callees.

# Usage Notes and Refactoring Suggestions

- **Extract Method**: The forward pass logic can be refactored by extracting methods for processing global and local branches separately. This would improve readability and maintainability.
  
  ```python
  def forward(self, x, t):
      global_output = self._process_global_branch(x, t)
      local_output = self._process_local_branch(x, t)
      weight = self.weight_network(t_emb)
      output = weight * global_output + (1 - weight) * local_output
      return output

  def _process_global_branch(self, x, t):
      x1_emb = self.input_mlp1(x[:, 0])
      x2_emb = self.input_mlp2(x[:, 1])
      t_emb = self.time_mlp(t)
      global_emb = torch.cat([x1_emb, x2_emb, t_emb], dim=-1)
      return self.global_network(global_emb)

  def _process_local_branch(self, x, t):
      x_upscaled = self.upscale(x)
      x1_upscaled_emb = self.input_mlp1(x_upscaled[:, 0])
      x2_upscaled_emb = self.input_mlp2(x_upscaled[:, 1])
      local_emb = torch.cat([x1_upscaled_emb, x2_upscaled_emb, t_emb], dim=-1)
      return self.local_network(local_emb)
  ```

- **Simplify Conditional Expressions**: If there are any conditional expressions in the code (not shown here), consider using guard clauses to simplify and improve readability.

- **Encapsulate Collection**: Ensure that any internal collections or configurations within the class are encapsulated properly, avoiding direct exposure of these details outside the class.

By applying these refactoring suggestions, the `MLPDenoiser` class can be made more modular, easier to understand, and better suited for future maintenance and extension.
### FunctionDef __init__(self, embedding_dim, hidden_dim, hidden_layers)
### Function Overview

The `__init__` function initializes an instance of the `MLPDenoiser` class, setting up various neural network components and configurations necessary for denoising tasks.

### Parameters

- **embedding_dim**: An integer representing the dimensionality of the embedding space used in the model. Default value is 128.
- **hidden_dim**: An integer specifying the number of units in each hidden layer of the global and local networks. Default value is 256.
- **hidden_layers**: An integer indicating the number of residual blocks in the global and local networks. Default value is 3.

### Return Values

The function does not return any values; it initializes the instance variables of the `MLPDenoiser` class.

### Detailed Explanation

The `__init__` function sets up the architecture for an MLP-based denoising model, which includes:

1. **Time Embedding**: Initializes a `SinusoidalEmbedding` layer (`time_mlp`) with the specified `embedding_dim`. This layer is used to encode time information in a sinusoidal manner.

2. **Input Embeddings**: Two more `SinusoidalEmbedding` layers (`input_mlp1` and `input_mlp2`) are initialized with the same `embedding_dim` but different scales (both set to 25.0). These layers process input data differently due to their distinct scaling factors.

3. **Global Network**: A sequential neural network (`global_network`) is constructed:
   - Starts with a linear layer that takes an input of size `embedding_dim * 3`.
   - Includes multiple `ResidualBlock` layers, each containing a linear transformation followed by a ReLU activation and a residual connection.
   - Ends with another ReLU activation and a final linear layer that outputs two units.

4. **Local Network**: Similar to the global network, but also includes:
   - A sequential neural network (`local_network`) with the same architecture as the global network.

5. **Upscale and Downscale Layers**: Two linear layers (`upscale` and `downscale`) are defined for upsampling and downsampling operations, respectively.

6. **Weight Network**: A sequential network (`weight_network`) is created to learn a weighting factor based on the timestep:
   - Starts with a linear layer that takes an input of size `embedding_dim`.
   - Includes a ReLU activation.
   - Ends with another linear layer that outputs one unit, followed by a sigmoid function to ensure the output is between 0 and 1.

### Relationship Description

- **Callers**: The `__init__` method is called when creating an instance of the `MLPDenoiser` class. It does not call any other methods or functions directly.
  
- **Callees**:
  - `SinusoidalEmbedding`: This class is instantiated twice (`time_mlp`, `input_mlp1`, and `input_mlp2`) within the `__init__` method.
  - `ResidualBlock`: This class is instantiated multiple times (based on `hidden_layers`) to form the core of the global and local networks.

### Usage Notes and Refactoring Suggestions

- **Encapsulate Collection**: The list comprehension used to create residual blocks could be encapsulated into a separate method if it becomes more complex or needs to be reused elsewhere. This would improve readability and maintainability.
  
  ```python
  def _create_residual_blocks(self, hidden_dim: int, num_layers: int) -> List[ResidualBlock]:
      return [ResidualBlock(hidden_dim) for _ in range(num_layers)]
  ```

- **Extract Method**: The logic for creating the global and local networks is repetitive. Extracting this into a separate method could reduce code duplication and improve maintainability.

  ```python
  def _create_network(self, input_size: int, hidden_dim: int, num_layers: int) -> nn.Sequential:
      layers = [nn.Linear(input_size, hidden_dim)]
      for _ in range(num_layers):
          layers.append(ResidualBlock(hidden_dim))
      layers.extend([nn.ReLU(), nn.Linear(hidden_dim, 2)])
      return nn.Sequential(*layers)
  ```

- **Introduce Explaining Variable**: The expression `embedding_dim * 3` is used multiple times. Introducing an explaining variable could improve clarity.

  ```python
  input_size = embedding_dim * 3
  global_network = self._create_network(input_size, hidden_dim, num_layers)
  local_network = self._create_network(input_size, hidden_dim, num_layers)
  ```

By applying these refactoring techniques, the code can become more modular, easier to read, and maintain.

### FunctionDef forward(self, x, t)
### Function Overview

The `forward` function is a core component of the `MLPDenoiser` class within the `run_1.py` module. This function processes input data through both global and local branches, calculates dynamic weights based on the timestep, and combines the outputs of these branches to produce the final denoised output.

### Parameters

- **x**: A tensor representing the input data. It is expected to have a shape where each element corresponds to different scales or features (e.g., `x[:, 0]` and `x[:, 1]`).
- **t**: A tensor representing the timestep information, which influences how the denoising process is weighted.

### Return Values

The function returns a single tensor, `output`, which represents the denoised data after processing through both global and local branches with dynamic weighting.

### Detailed Explanation

1. **Input Embedding**:
   - The input tensor `x` is split into two parts, `x[:, 0]` and `x[:, 1]`, each passed through separate MLPs (`input_mlp1` and `input_mlp2`) to generate embeddings `x1_emb` and `x2_emb`.
   - The timestep tensor `t` is also embedded using the `time_mlp` to produce `t_emb`.

2. **Global Branch**:
   - The global embedding is created by concatenating `x1_emb`, `x2_emb`, and `t_emb` along the last dimension.
   - This concatenated tensor is then passed through a global network (`global_network`) to generate `global_output`.

3. **Local Branch with Upscaling**:
   - The input data `x` is upscaled using an upscale operation, resulting in `x_upscaled`.
   - Similar to the global branch, `x_upscaled[:, 0]` and `x_upscaled[:, 1]` are embedded using `input_mlp1` and `input_mlp2`, respectively, to produce `x1_upscaled_emb` and `x2_upscaled_emb`.
   - These embeddings, along with `t_emb`, are concatenated to form `local_emb`, which is then passed through a local network (`local_network`) to generate `local_output`.

4. **Dynamic Weight Calculation**:
   - A dynamic weight is calculated based on the timestep embedding `t_emb` using the `weight_network`.
   - This weight determines how much influence each branch (global or local) has on the final output.

5. **Combining Outputs**:
   - The final output is computed by combining `global_output` and `local_output` with the dynamic weight, ensuring that the contributions of both branches are balanced according to the timestep.

### Relationship Description

- **Callers**: This function is likely called by other components within the project that require denoising operations. These callers would provide the input data `x` and timestep information `t`.
- **Callees**: The function internally calls several subcomponents, including MLPs (`input_mlp1`, `input_mlp2`, `time_mlp`) and networks (`global_network`, `local_network`, `weight_network`). These components are responsible for specific parts of the denoising process.

### Usage Notes and Refactoring Suggestions

- **Complexity in Embedding Calculation**: The embedding calculation involves multiple steps and concatenations. Consider using an **Extract Method** to encapsulate this logic into a separate method, improving readability.
  
  ```python
  def _calculate_embeddings(self, x, t):
      x1_emb = self.input_mlp1(x[:, 0])
      x2_emb = self.input_mlp2(x[:, 1])
      t_emb = self.time_mlp(t)
      return x1_emb, x2_emb, t_emb
  ```

- **Dynamic Weight Calculation**: The dynamic weight calculation is straightforward but could benefit from an **Introduce Explaining Variable** to clarify the purpose of each step in the weight computation.

  ```python
  def _calculate_dynamic_weight(self, t_emb):
      weight = self.weight_network(t_emb)
      return weight
  ```

- **Combining Outputs**: The combination of global and local outputs could be simplified by using a helper method to encapsulate this logic, enhancing modularity.

  ```python
  def _combine_outputs(self, global_output, local_output, weight):
      output = weight * global_output + (1 - weight) * local_output
      return output
  ```

- **Overall Refactoring**: Consider refactoring the entire `forward` method to use these helper methods, which would make the code more modular and easier to maintain.

  ```python
  def forward(self, x, t):
      x1_emb, x2_emb, t_emb = self._calculate_embeddings(x, t)
      
      # Global branch
      global_emb = torch.cat([x1_emb, x2_emb, t_emb], dim=-1)
      global_output = self.global_network

## ClassDef NoiseScheduler
---

### Function Overview

The `NoiseScheduler` class is designed to manage noise scheduling parameters and operations for a diffusion-based denoising process, enabling the generation of noisy samples from clean data and vice versa.

### Parameters

- **num_timesteps**: An integer specifying the total number of timesteps in the noise schedule. Default value is 1000.
- **beta_start**: A float representing the starting value for the beta parameter at the first timestep. Default value is 0.0001.
- **beta_end**: A float representing the ending value for the beta parameter at the last timestep. Default value is 0.02.
- **beta_schedule**: A string indicating the schedule type for the beta parameters, either "linear" or "quadratic". Default value is "linear".

### Return Values

- The class does not return any values from its methods; instead, it modifies internal state and returns tensors representing denoised samples.

### Detailed Explanation

The `NoiseScheduler` class initializes with a specified number of timesteps and beta parameters that define the noise schedule. The constructor calculates various intermediate parameters such as alphas, cumulative products of alphas, and coefficients for posterior mean calculations. These parameters are essential for adding noise to clean data (`add_noise`) and reconstructing original samples from noisy ones (`reconstruct_x0`).

The class provides methods for:
- **Reconstructing Original Samples**: `reconstruct_x0(x_t, t, noise)` uses the inverse cumulative product of alphas to denoise a sample.
- **Calculating Posterior Mean**: `q_posterior(x_0, x_t, t)` computes the mean of the posterior distribution over latent variables.
- **Getting Variance**: `get_variance(t)` returns the variance at a given timestep.
- **Taking a Step in Denoising Process**: `step(model_output, timestep, sample)` performs one step of denoising by predicting the original sample and adding noise if not at the first timestep.
- **Adding Noise to Clean Data**: `add_noise(x_start, x_noise, timesteps)` adds specified noise to clean data based on the cumulative product of alphas.

### Relationship Description

The `NoiseScheduler` class is likely used within a larger diffusion model framework where it interacts with other components such as data loaders, models, and trainers. It serves as a central component for managing noise scheduling, which is crucial for both training and inference phases of the denoising process.

### Usage Notes and Refactoring Suggestions

- **Extract Method**: The `get_variance` method could be refactored to extract common calculations into separate methods if it becomes more complex or reused in multiple places.
  
  ```python
  def calculate_beta(t):
      # Extracted calculation for beta at timestep t
      pass
  
  def get_variance(self, t):
      beta_t = self.calculate_beta(t)
      return beta_t * (1 - self.alphas_cumprod[t-1]) / self.alphas_cumprod[t]
  ```

- **Introduce Explaining Variable**: The expression for `beta_t` in the `get_variance` method could be simplified by introducing an explaining variable.

  ```python
  def get_variance(self, t):
      beta_t = self.betas[t]
      variance = beta_t * (1 - self.alphas_cumprod[t-1]) / self.alphas_cumprod[t]
      return variance
  ```

- **Replace Conditional with Polymorphism**: If the `beta_schedule` parameter is extended to support more types of schedules, consider using polymorphism to handle different scheduling strategies.

  ```python
  class LinearSchedule:
      def calculate_beta(self, t):
          # Implementation for linear schedule
          pass
  
  class QuadraticSchedule:
      def calculate_beta(self, t):
          # Implementation for quadratic schedule
          pass
  
  class NoiseScheduler:
      def __init__(self, num_timesteps, beta_start, beta_end, beta_schedule_type):
          self.schedule = {
              'linear': LinearSchedule(),
              'quadratic': QuadraticSchedule()
          }[beta_schedule_type]
  
      def get_variance(self, t):
          beta_t = self.schedule.calculate_beta(t)
          return beta_t * (1 - self.alphas_cumprod[t-1]) / self.alphas_cumprod[t]
  ```

- **Simplify Conditional Expressions**: If there are multiple conditionals in the constructor or other methods, consider using guard clauses to improve readability.

  ```python
  def __init__(self, num_timesteps, beta_start, beta_end, beta_schedule='linear'):
      if not (0 < beta_start < beta_end):
          raise ValueError("beta_start must be less than beta_end and both must be positive.")
  
      self.num_timesteps = num_timesteps
      self.betas = torch.linspace(beta_start, beta_end, num_timesteps)
  ```

- **Encapsulate Collection**: If the class exposes internal collections like `betas`
### FunctionDef __init__(self, num_timesteps, beta_start, beta_end, beta_schedule)
**Function Overview**: The `__init__` function initializes a `NoiseScheduler` instance with parameters defining the number of timesteps and the schedule for beta values. It calculates various cumulative products and coefficients used in noise scheduling processes.

**Parameters**:
- `num_timesteps`: An integer representing the total number of timesteps in the noise process. Default is 1000.
- `beta_start`: A float indicating the starting value of the beta schedule. Default is 0.0001.
- `beta_end`: A float indicating the ending value of the beta schedule. Default is 0.02.
- `beta_schedule`: A string specifying the type of beta schedule ("linear" or "quadratic"). Default is "linear".

**Return Values**: None

**Detailed Explanation**:
The `__init__` function sets up a noise scheduling process by initializing several attributes based on the provided parameters and calculations. Here’s a step-by-step breakdown:

1. **Initialization of Basic Attributes**:
   - `self.num_timesteps`: Stores the number of timesteps.
   - `self.betas`: A tensor containing beta values generated according to the specified schedule ("linear" or "quadratic"). If an unknown schedule is provided, it raises a `ValueError`.

2. **Calculations for Alphas and Cumulative Products**:
   - `self.alphas`: Calculated as 1 minus each beta value.
   - `self.alphas_cumprod`: The cumulative product of alphas, representing the probability of not adding noise up to a certain timestep.
   - `self.alphas_cumprod_prev`: A tensor similar to `alphas_cumprod` but padded with an initial value of 1.

3. **Calculations for Noise Addition**:
   - `self.sqrt_alphas_cumprod`: The square root of the cumulative product of alphas, used in adding noise.
   - `self.sqrt_one_minus_alphas_cumprod`: The square root of one minus the cumulative product of alphas, also used in noise addition.

4. **Calculations for Reconstruction**:
   - `self.sqrt_inv_alphas_cumprod`: The square root of the inverse of the cumulative product of alphas, used in reconstructing the original data.
   - `self.sqrt_inv_alphas_cumprod_minus_one`: The square root of the difference between 1 and the inverse of the cumulative product of alphas.

5. **Calculations for Posterior Mean Coefficients**:
   - `self.posterior_mean_coef1` and `self.posterior_mean_coef2`: These coefficients are used in calculating the posterior mean during denoising processes.

The function ensures that all necessary attributes are initialized correctly based on the input parameters, facilitating subsequent operations within the noise scheduling process.

**Relationship Description**: 
- **referencer_content**: The `__init__` method is called when a new instance of `NoiseScheduler` is created. It serves as the entry point for setting up the scheduler with specific configurations.
- **reference_letter**: This function does not reference any other components within the project, meaning it acts independently in its initialization process.

**Usage Notes and Refactoring Suggestions**:
- The logic for generating beta values based on the schedule could be extracted into a separate method to improve readability and maintainability. This would align with the **Extract Method** refactoring technique.
  
  ```python
  def _generate_betas(self, num_timesteps, beta_start, beta_end, beta_schedule):
      if beta_schedule == "linear":
          return torch.linspace(beta_start, beta_end, num_timesteps, dtype=torch.float32).to(device)
      elif beta_schedule == "quadratic":
          betas = torch.linspace(beta_start ** 0.5, beta_end ** 0.5, num_timesteps, dtype=torch.float32) ** 2
          return betas.to(device)
      else:
          raise ValueError(f"Unknown beta schedule: {beta_schedule}")
  ```

- The use of multiple conditional statements for calculating different coefficients could be simplified by using a dictionary to map schedules to their respective calculation functions. This would improve the modularity and readability of the code, aligning with **Replace Conditional with Polymorphism**.

  ```python
  def _calculate_coefficients(self, betas):
      alphas = 1.0 - betas
      alphas_cumprod = torch.cumprod(alphas, axis=0).to(device)
      alphas_cumprod_prev = F.pad(alphas_cumprod[:-1], (1, 0), value=1)

      sqrt_alphas_cumprod = torch.sqrt(alphas_cumprod)
      sqrt_one_minus_alphas_cumprod = torch.sqrt(1 - alphas_cumprod)

      sqrt_inv_alphas_cumprod = torch.sqrt(1 / alphas_cumprod)
      sqrt_inv_alphas_cumprod_minus_one = torch.sqrt(1 / alphas_cumprod - 1)

      posterior_mean_coef1 = betas * torch.sqrt(al
***
### FunctionDef reconstruct_x0(self, x_t, t, noise)
## Function Overview

The `reconstruct_x0` function is designed to reconstruct the initial sample \( x_0 \) from a given noisy sample \( x_t \) and noise at a specific timestep \( t \).

## Parameters

- **x_t**: The noisy sample tensor at time step \( t \).
- **t**: The current timestep.
- **noise**: The noise tensor used to generate the noisy sample.

## Return Values

The function returns the reconstructed initial sample \( x_0 \) as a tensor.

## Detailed Explanation

The `reconstruct_x0` function performs the following operations:

1. **Retrieve Scaling Factors**:
   - It retrieves two scaling factors from the `self.sqrt_inv_alphas_cumprod` and `self.sqrt_inv_alphas_cumprod_minus_one` arrays based on the current timestep \( t \). These factors are denoted as \( s1 \) and \( s2 \), respectively.

2. **Reshape Scaling Factors**:
   - Both scaling factors \( s1 \) and \( s2 \) are reshaped to match the dimensions of the input tensors for element-wise multiplication.

3. **Reconstruct Initial Sample**:
   - The initial sample \( x_0 \) is reconstructed using the formula:
     \[
     x_0 = s1 \times x_t - s2 \times noise
     \]
   - This operation effectively reverses the diffusion process by removing the noise component from the noisy sample.

## Relationship Description

The `reconstruct_x0` function is called by the `step` method within the same class. The relationship can be described as follows:

- **Caller**: The `step` method calls `reconstruct_x0` to obtain the original sample \( x_0 \) from the noisy sample and noise at a given timestep.
- **Callee**: `reconstruct_x0` is called by the `step` method, which then uses the reconstructed sample for further processing.

## Usage Notes and Refactoring Suggestions

### Limitations
- The function assumes that the input tensors \( x_t \) and noise have compatible shapes for element-wise operations.
- The function does not handle cases where the timestep \( t \) is out of bounds for the `self.sqrt_inv_alphas_cumprod` and `self.sqrt_inv_alphas_cumprod_minus_one` arrays.

### Refactoring Opportunities
1. **Introduce Explaining Variable**:
   - Introducing explaining variables for complex expressions can improve readability.
     ```python
     def reconstruct_x0(self, x_t, t, noise):
         s1 = self.sqrt_inv_alphas_cumprod[t].reshape(-1, 1)
         s2 = self.sqrt_inv_alphas_cumprod_minus_one[t].reshape(-1, 1)
         
         # Introduce explaining variables
         scaled_x_t = s1 * x_t
         scaled_noise = s2 * noise
         
         return scaled_x_t - scaled_noise
     ```

2. **Encapsulate Collection**:
   - If `self.sqrt_inv_alphas_cumprod` and `self.sqrt_inv_alphas_cumprod_minus_one` are large arrays, consider encapsulating them within a class or using properties to manage access and validation.
   
3. **Error Handling**:
   - Adding error handling for out-of-bounds timesteps can make the function more robust.

By applying these refactoring suggestions, the code can become more readable, maintainable, and less prone to errors.

### FunctionDef q_posterior(self, x_0, x_t, t)
---

**Function Overview**: The `q_posterior` function calculates the posterior mean of a sample given the original sample (`x_0`), the noisy sample (`x_t`), and the current timestep (`t`). This calculation is crucial for denoising processes in adaptive dual-scale models.

**Parameters**:
- **x_0**: A tensor representing the original, noise-free sample.
- **x_t**: A tensor representing the noisy sample at the current timestep.
- **t**: An integer representing the current timestep in the diffusion process.

**Return Values**:
- **mu**: A tensor representing the posterior mean of the sample.

**Detailed Explanation**:
The `q_posterior` function computes the posterior mean (`mu`) using coefficients derived from the model's parameters at the given timestep `t`. The logic involves:
1. Fetching two coefficients, `s1` and `s2`, from the model's parameters for the current timestep.
2. Reshaping these coefficients to ensure they can be broadcasted correctly with the input tensors.
3. Calculating the posterior mean (`mu`) as a weighted sum of the original sample (`x_0`) and the noisy sample (`x_t`), using `s1` and `s2` as weights.

**Relationship Description**:
- **Callers**: The function is called by the `step` method within the same class. This relationship indicates that `q_posterior` is part of a larger process where it contributes to denoising steps.
- **Callees**: There are no direct callees from this function; it performs calculations and returns a result without calling other functions.

**Usage Notes and Refactoring Suggestions**:
- **Extract Method**: The reshaping of `s1` and `s2` could be extracted into its own method if this operation is reused elsewhere or becomes more complex.
  - Example: Create a method named `reshape_coefficients(t)` that handles the reshaping logic.
  
- **Introduce Explaining Variable**: The expression for calculating `mu` can be broken down into an intermediate variable to enhance readability.
  - Example:
    ```python
    s1_reshaped = self.posterior_mean_coef1[t].reshape(-1, 1)
    s2_reshaped = self.posterior_mean_coef2[t].reshape(-1, 1)
    weighted_x0 = s1_reshaped * x_0
    weighted_xt = s2_reshaped * x_t
    mu = weighted_x0 + weighted_xt
    ```

- **Simplify Conditional Expressions**: The conditional check in the `step` method could be simplified using a guard clause to improve readability.
  - Example:
    ```python
    def step(self, model_output, timestep, sample):
        t = timestep
        pred_original_sample = self.reconstruct_x0(sample, t, model_output)
        
        if t == 0:
            return pred_original_sample
        
        pred_prev_sample = self.q_posterior(pred_original_sample, sample, t)
        noise = torch.randn_like(model_output)
        variance = (self.get_variance(t) ** 0.5) * noise
        pred_prev_sample += variance

        return pred_prev_sample
    ```

- **Encapsulate Collection**: If `posterior_mean_coef1` and `posterior_mean_coef2` are large collections, consider encapsulating them in a separate class or structure to improve modularity.
  - Example: Create a `CoefficientsManager` class that handles the storage and retrieval of these coefficients.

These refactoring suggestions aim to enhance the readability, maintainability, and scalability of the code, making it easier to understand and modify in the future.

### FunctionDef get_variance(self, t)
### Function Overview

The `get_variance` function calculates the variance at a given timestep `t` based on predefined parameters such as betas and alphas cumulative products.

### Parameters

- **t**: An integer representing the current timestep. This parameter is used to index into arrays of precomputed betas and alphas cumulative products to compute the variance.

### Return Values

The function returns a single floating-point number representing the computed variance at the given timestep `t`.

### Detailed Explanation

The `get_variance` function computes the variance for a specific timestep in a diffusion process, which is commonly used in generative models like denoising autoencoders. The logic follows these steps:

1. **Base Case Check**: If the timestep `t` is 0, the function immediately returns 0 because there is no variance at the initial state.

2. **Variance Calculation**:
   - The variance is calculated using the formula: 
     \[
     \text{variance} = \beta_t \times \frac{(1 - \alpha_{\text{cumprod}}^{\text{prev}}[t])}{(1 - \alpha_{\text{cumprod}}[t])}
     \]
   - Here, `self.betas[t]` represents the beta value at timestep `t`, and `self.alphas_cumprod_prev[t]` and `self.alphas_cumprod[t]` are cumulative products of alpha values up to the previous and current timesteps, respectively.

3. **Clipping**: The computed variance is clipped to a minimum value of \(1 \times 10^{-20}\) to prevent numerical instability or underflow issues in subsequent computations.

### Relationship Description

The `get_variance` function is called by the `step` method within the same class (`NoiseScheduler`). This relationship indicates that the variance calculation is part of a larger process where the model output and sample are updated based on the computed variance. The `step` method uses the variance to add noise to the predicted previous sample, which is a crucial step in the diffusion denoising process.

### Usage Notes and Refactoring Suggestions

- **Clipping Value**: The clipping value of \(1 \times 10^{-20}\) is hardcoded. Consider making this a configurable parameter if it needs to be adjusted for different models or scenarios.
  
- **Code Readability**: The variance calculation formula could benefit from an explaining variable to improve readability:
  ```python
  alpha_ratio = (1 - self.alphas_cumprod_prev[t]) / (1 - self.alphas_cumprod[t])
  variance = self.betas[t] * alpha_ratio
  ```
  
- **Guard Clause**: The base case check for `t == 0` can be simplified by using a guard clause to exit early:
  ```python
  if t == 0:
      return 0

  # Rest of the function logic
  ```

These refactoring suggestions aim to enhance the code's readability and maintainability without altering its functionality.

### FunctionDef add_noise(self, x_start, x_noise, timesteps)
**Function Overview**

The `add_noise` function is designed to add noise to a starting signal (`x_start`) based on predefined noise levels and timesteps. This function plays a crucial role in simulating noisy data for denoising algorithms.

**Parameters**

- **x_start**: The original signal or image from which noise will be added.
  - Type: Typically an array or tensor, depending on the implementation context.
  - Description: Represents the clean data that needs to be corrupted with noise.

- **x_noise**: The noise signal to be added to `x_start`.
  - Type: Similar to `x_start`, usually an array or tensor of the same dimensions.
  - Description: This is the noise component that will be mixed with the original signal.

- **timesteps**: An index into predefined arrays (`sqrt_alphas_cumprod` and `sqrt_one_minus_alphas_cumprod`) that determine how much noise to add at each step.
  - Type: Integer or array of integers.
  - Description: Specifies which timesteps' noise characteristics should be applied. This parameter allows for adaptive scaling of noise over time.

**Return Values**

- **Noisy Signal**: The function returns a new signal that is the result of adding the specified amount of noise to `x_start`.
  - Type: Same as `x_start` and `x_noise`, typically an array or tensor.
  - Description: This output can be used for training denoising models by providing them with noisy inputs.

**Detailed Explanation**

The function `add_noise` operates by scaling the original signal (`x_start`) and noise signal (`x_noise`) using precomputed values from arrays `sqrt_alphas_cumprod` and `sqrt_one_minus_alphas_cumprod`. These arrays are indexed by `timesteps`, which allows for adaptive noise addition over time. The logic can be broken down as follows:

1. **Retrieve Scaling Factors**: 
   - `s1 = self.sqrt_alphas_cumprod[timesteps]`
   - `s2 = self.sqrt_one_minus_alphas_cumprod[timesteps]`

2. **Reshape Scaling Factors**:
   - Both `s1` and `s2` are reshaped to have a shape of `(-1, 1)`. This ensures that they can be broadcasted correctly when multiplied with `x_start` and `x_noise`, respectively.

3. **Combine Signals**:
   - The final noisy signal is computed as: `s1 * x_start + s2 * x_noise`
   - This operation linearly combines the original signal and noise, where `s1` controls the proportion of the original signal and `s2` controls the proportion of the added noise.

**Relationship Description**

The function `add_noise` is likely called by other components within the project that require noisy data for training or testing denoising algorithms. It does not call any other functions directly but relies on the precomputed arrays (`sqrt_alphas_cumprod` and `sqrt_one_minus_alphas_cumprod`) which are presumably set up elsewhere in the code.

**Usage Notes and Refactoring Suggestions**

- **Edge Cases**: Ensure that `timesteps` is within the valid range of indices for `sqrt_alphas_cumprod` and `sqrt_one_minus_alphas_cumprod`. Otherwise, this could lead to index errors.
  
- **Refactoring Opportunities**:
  - **Introduce Explaining Variable**: The expression `s1 * x_start + s2 * x_noise` can be assigned to an explaining variable named `noisy_signal`, which improves readability and makes the code easier to maintain.
    ```python
    noisy_signal = s1 * x_start + s2 * x_noise
    return noisy_signal
    ```
  - **Encapsulate Collection**: If `sqrt_alphas_cumprod` and `sqrt_one_minus_alphas_cumprod` are large or complex, consider encapsulating them within a class or a configuration object. This would improve modularity and make the code easier to manage.
  
- **Limitations**: The function assumes that `x_start`, `x_noise`, and the noise scaling arrays have compatible shapes for broadcasting. If these assumptions do not hold, the function will raise shape mismatch errors.

By addressing these points, the function can be made more robust, readable, and maintainable.
***
### FunctionDef __len__(self)
---

**Function Overview**: The `__len__` function is designed to return the number of timesteps associated with an instance of the `NoiseScheduler` class.

**Parameters**:
- **referencer_content**: This parameter indicates if there are references (callers) from other components within the project to this component. In this case, it is truthy, suggesting that other parts of the project might call this function.
- **reference_letter**: This parameter shows if there is a reference to this component from other project parts, representing callees in the relationship. It is not provided here, indicating no specific callees are mentioned.

**Return Values**: The function returns an integer value, `self.num_timesteps`, which represents the total number of timesteps configured for the noise scheduling process.

**Detailed Explanation**: The `__len__` method is a special method in Python that allows instances of a class to be used with the built-in `len()` function. In this implementation, it simply returns the value stored in the instance variable `self.num_timesteps`. This method does not take any additional parameters and does not perform any complex operations or calculations.

**Relationship Description**: Since `referencer_content` is truthy, it indicates that there are other components within the project that might call the `__len__` function. However, without specific details about these references, it is unclear which parts of the project interact with this method. If there were a `reference_letter`, it would provide information about which components or functions are called by `__len__`.

**Usage Notes and Refactoring Suggestions**: 
- **Limitations**: The current implementation assumes that `self.num_timesteps` is always set to a valid integer value. If this assumption does not hold, the function could return an incorrect length.
- **Edge Cases**: Consider edge cases where `self.num_timesteps` might be zero or negative. Depending on the context, additional checks or error handling might be necessary.
- **Refactoring Opportunities**:
  - **Encapsulate Collection**: If `self.num_timesteps` is part of a larger collection or configuration object, consider encapsulating this logic within its own class to improve modularity and maintainability.

---

This documentation provides a clear understanding of the `__len__` function's purpose, parameters, return values, and potential relationships within the project. It also highlights areas for consideration regarding limitations and suggests refactoring techniques to enhance the code's robustness and maintainability.
