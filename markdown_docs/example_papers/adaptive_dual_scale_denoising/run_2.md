## ClassDef SinusoidalEmbedding
# Function Overview

The `SinusoidalEmbedding` class is designed to generate embeddings using a sinusoidal function. This technique is commonly used in transformer models to encode positional information into input sequences.

# Parameters

- **dim**: The dimensionality of the embedding output. It determines the size of the vector that will be generated.
  - **referencer_content**: True
  - **reference_letter**: False

# Return Values

The class does not return any values directly. Instead, it provides a method `forward` that takes an input tensor and returns the embedded output.

# Detailed Explanation

The `SinusoidalEmbedding` class is initialized with a single parameter, `dim`, which specifies the dimensionality of the embedding vectors. The primary logic of the class is encapsulated within the `forward` method:

1. **Input Tensor**: The method takes an input tensor `x` of shape `(batch_size, seq_len)`.
2. **Positional Encoding**: It generates a positional encoding matrix based on the sequence length and the specified dimensionality.
3. **Embedding Calculation**: The input tensor is then embedded using the generated positional encoding.

The key steps in the `forward` method are as follows:

- **Generate Position Tensor**: A position tensor is created with shape `(seq_len, 1)`, representing positions from 0 to `seq_len - 1`.
- **Divide by Dimensionality**: The position tensor is divided by a factor derived from the dimensionality (`dim // 2`), and then multiplied by a constant factor (typically `10000.0`) for scaling.
- **Apply Sinusoidal Functions**: Sine and cosine functions are applied to the scaled positions, resulting in two sets of embeddings.
- **Concatenate Embeddings**: The sine and cosine embeddings are concatenated along the last dimension to form the final embedding tensor.

# Relationship Description

The `SinusoidalEmbedding` class is referenced by other components within the project. Specifically:

- **Callers**: The `MLPBlock` class in the same module uses `SinusoidalEmbedding` as a component for generating positional embeddings.
- **Callees**: There are no callees from this component to other parts of the project.

# Usage Notes and Refactoring Suggestions

- **Introduce Explaining Variable**: The expression `torch.arange(seq_len, device=x.device).unsqueeze(1) / (dim // 2)` can be assigned to an explaining variable for better readability.
  
  ```python
  position_tensor = torch.arange(seq_len, device=x.device).unsqueeze(1)
  scaled_positions = position_tensor / (dim // 2)
  ```

- **Replace Conditional with Polymorphism**: If there are different types of embedding layers that could be used, consider using polymorphism to handle them.

- **Simplify Conditional Expressions**: Ensure all conditional expressions are clear and concise. The current code does not have complex conditionals, but this is a good practice for future maintenance.

By applying these refactoring techniques, the code can become more modular, easier to read, and maintainable.
### FunctionDef __init__(self, dim, scale)
**Function Overview**: The `__init__` function initializes a SinusoidalEmbedding instance with specified dimensions and scale.

**Parameters**:
- **dim (int)**: Specifies the dimension of the embedding. This parameter is essential as it defines the size of the output vector produced by the sinusoidal embedding.
- **scale (float, optional)**: Defines the scaling factor for the sinusoidal functions used in the embedding. The default value is 1.0, but this can be adjusted to control the frequency or amplitude of the embeddings.

**Return Values**: None

**Detailed Explanation**: 
The `__init__` function serves as the constructor for the SinusoidalEmbedding class. It initializes two instance variables: `dim`, which stores the dimensionality of the embedding, and `scale`, which controls the scaling factor applied to the sinusoidal functions. The function first calls the superclass's `__init__` method to ensure proper initialization of any base class attributes. Following this, it assigns the provided `dim` and `scale` values to the respective instance variables.

**Relationship Description**: 
There is no functional relationship described based on the provided information. This suggests that either there are no references from other components within the project to this component (`referencer_content` is falsy), or there is no reference to this component from other parts of the project (`reference_letter` is falsy).

**Usage Notes and Refactoring Suggestions**: 
- **Parameter Validation**: Consider adding validation for the `dim` parameter to ensure it is a positive integer. This can prevent errors in scenarios where an invalid dimension might lead to unexpected behavior.
  - *Refactoring Technique*: Introduce Guard Clauses to handle invalid inputs gracefully, improving robustness and maintainability.

- **Documentation**: Enhance documentation by adding type hints for better readability and understanding of the expected input types.
  - *Refactoring Technique*: Use Type Hints to specify the expected data types for parameters and return values, which can improve code clarity and help with static analysis tools.

- **Code Clarity**: The current implementation is straightforward and does not require significant refactoring. However, if additional functionality or complexity is added in future updates, consider encapsulating related logic into separate methods.
  - *Refactoring Technique*: Extract Method for any complex logic that might be introduced, ensuring each method has a single responsibility.

Overall, the `__init__` function is well-structured and performs its intended role effectively. The suggested refactoring techniques aim to enhance code quality, maintainability, and robustness without altering its core functionality.

### FunctionDef forward(self, x)
### Function Overview

The `forward` function is responsible for generating sinusoidal embeddings from input tensor `x`. This embedding process involves scaling the input, computing positional encodings, and concatenating sine and cosine transformations of these encodings.

### Parameters

- **x**: A `torch.Tensor` representing the input data to be embedded. The function processes this tensor to generate positional embeddings.

### Return Values

The function returns a `torch.Tensor` containing the sinusoidal embeddings derived from the input tensor `x`.

### Detailed Explanation

1. **Scaling the Input**:
   - The input tensor `x` is multiplied by a scaling factor stored in `self.scale`. This step adjusts the magnitude of the input data before further processing.

2. **Computing Positional Encodings**:
   - The dimensionality for the embeddings is determined by `self.dim`, and half of this dimension (`half_dim`) is calculated.
   - An exponential decay term is computed using `torch.log(torch.Tensor([10000.0])) / (half_dim - 1)`. This term helps in creating a smooth transition between different frequency components.

3. **Generating Embeddings**:
   - The exponential decay term is further processed by taking the exponential of its negative values multiplied by a range from `0` to `half_dim - 1`.
   - These embeddings are then expanded and broadcasted to match the dimensions of the input tensor `x` using `unsqueeze` operations.
   - The final embedding is generated by concatenating the sine and cosine transformations of the computed embeddings along the last dimension.

### Relationship Description

The `forward` function does not have any explicit references or relationships with other components within the project as indicated by the provided information. Therefore, there is no functional relationship to describe in this context.

### Usage Notes and Refactoring Suggestions

- **Extract Method**: The computation of positional encodings could be extracted into a separate method to enhance modularity and readability.
  
  ```python
  def compute_positional_encodings(self, half_dim):
      emb = torch.log(torch.Tensor([10000.0])) / (half_dim - 1)
      return torch.exp(-emb * torch.arange(half_dim)).to(device)
  ```

- **Introduce Explaining Variable**: The expression for computing the exponential decay term could be stored in an explaining variable to improve clarity.

  ```python
  log_term = torch.log(torch.Tensor([10000.0]))
  exp_decay = log_term / (half_dim - 1)
  ```

- **Simplify Conditional Expressions**: If there are any conditional checks within the function, consider using guard clauses to simplify and improve readability.

By applying these refactoring suggestions, the code can become more modular, easier to understand, and maintainable.
***
## ClassDef ResidualBlock
# Function Overview

The `ResidualBlock` class is a fundamental building block used within neural networks, specifically designed to enhance training stability and speed up convergence through residual connections.

# Parameters

- **width**: An integer representing the number of neurons (input and output dimensions) in the linear layer. This parameter determines the width of the network at this particular block.

# Return Values

The `ResidualBlock` returns a tensor that is the sum of the input tensor `x` and the result of passing `x` through a series of operations defined within the block.

# Detailed Explanation

The `ResidualBlock` implements a simple yet powerful concept in deep learning known as residual learning. It consists of two main components:

1. **Linear Layer**: A fully connected layer (`nn.Linear`) that transforms the input tensor `x` from its original dimension to the specified width.
2. **ReLU Activation**: An activation function (`nn.ReLU`) applied after the linear transformation, which introduces non-linearity into the network.

The core logic of the `ResidualBlock` is as follows:

- The input tensor `x` is passed through a linear layer that projects it into a higher-dimensional space defined by the `width` parameter.
- The result of this projection is then passed through a ReLU activation function, which introduces non-linearity and helps the network learn complex patterns.
- Finally, the original input tensor `x` is added to the output of the ReLU activation. This residual connection allows gradients to flow more easily during backpropagation, mitigating issues like vanishing gradients that are common in deep networks.

# Relationship Description

The `ResidualBlock` is referenced by other components within the project, specifically in the construction of neural network architectures such as those used in the `__init__` method of a larger model class. It acts as a callee in these relationships, being instantiated and integrated into larger models to enhance their learning capabilities.

# Usage Notes and Refactoring Suggestions

- **Encapsulate Collection**: If there are multiple instances of `ResidualBlock` within a network architecture, consider encapsulating them within a collection or module to simplify management and potential future modifications.
- **Simplify Conditional Expressions**: Although the current implementation does not involve complex conditionals, ensuring that any future enhancements maintain simplicity is crucial for readability and maintainability.
- **Introduce Explaining Variable**: If the logic within the `ResidualBlock` becomes more complex (e.g., adding additional layers or transformations), introducing explaining variables can help clarify the flow of data through the block.

By applying these refactoring techniques, the code can become more modular, easier to read, and maintainable.
### FunctionDef __init__(self, width)
## Function Overview

The `__init__` function initializes a new instance of the `ResidualBlock` class with a specified width parameter.

## Parameters

- **width**: An integer representing the number of input and output features for the linear transformation layer (`nn.Linear`). This parameter determines the dimensionality of the data processed by the block.

## Return Values

The function does not return any values; it initializes the instance variables `ff` and `act`.

## Detailed Explanation

The `__init__` method sets up the basic structure of a residual block, which is a fundamental component in neural network architectures designed to facilitate training very deep networks by allowing gradients to flow more easily through the layers. The method performs the following steps:

1. **Inheritance Initialization**: Calls the parent class's `__init__` method using `super().__init__()`. This ensures that any initialization required by the parent class is properly handled.

2. **Linear Transformation Layer (`ff`)**: Initializes a fully connected linear layer (`nn.Linear`) with the specified width as both input and output dimensions. This layer will perform a linear transformation on the input data, mapping it to the same dimensionality.

3. **Activation Function (`act`)**: Initializes a ReLU (Rectified Linear Unit) activation function (`nn.ReLU`). The ReLU function introduces non-linearity into the model, allowing it to learn more complex patterns in the data.

The combination of these two layers forms the core of a residual block, where the input is passed through a linear transformation followed by an activation function. This structure is commonly used in architectures like ResNet, which rely on skip connections (residual connections) to mitigate issues such as vanishing gradients during training.

## Relationship Description

There are no references provided for this component (`referencer_content` and `reference_letter` are not present). Therefore, there is no functional relationship to describe regarding callers or callees within the project.

## Usage Notes and Refactoring Suggestions

- **Parameter Validation**: Consider adding input validation to ensure that the `width` parameter is a positive integer. This can prevent errors during initialization if invalid values are passed.
  
  ```python
  def __init__(self, width: int):
      assert width > 0, "Width must be a positive integer"
      super().__init__()
      self.ff = nn.Linear(width, width)
      self.act = nn.ReLU()
  ```

- **Encapsulate Collection**: If this block is part of a larger network architecture that manages multiple residual blocks, consider encapsulating the collection of these blocks to improve modularity and maintainability. This can be achieved by creating a separate class or module to manage the collection.

- **Extract Method**: If additional layers or operations are added to the `__init__` method in the future, consider extracting them into separate methods to adhere to the Single Responsibility Principle. For example:

  ```python
  def __init__(self, width: int):
      super().__init__()
      self._initialize_layers(width)

  def _initialize_layers(self, width: int):
      self.ff = nn.Linear(width, width)
      self.act = nn.ReLU()
  ```

- **Replace Conditional with Polymorphism**: If different types of activation functions or linear transformations are needed based on certain conditions, consider using polymorphism by defining a base class for residual blocks and subclassing it for specific variations. This approach enhances flexibility and maintainability.

By applying these refactoring suggestions, the code can become more robust, modular, and easier to manage as the project evolves.
***
### FunctionDef forward(self, x)
## Function Overview

The `forward` function is a core component of the ResidualBlock class within the adaptive_dual_scale_denoising module. It processes input tensor `x` by adding the result of applying an activation function followed by a feed-forward network to the original input.

## Parameters

- **x**: A `torch.Tensor` representing the input data that will be processed through the residual block.
  - **referencer_content**: True
  - **reference_letter**: False

## Return Values

The function returns a `torch.Tensor`, which is the result of adding the original input tensor `x` to the output of the feed-forward network applied to the activated version of `x`.

## Detailed Explanation

The `forward` function implements a residual connection, a key concept in deep learning architectures. The logic can be broken down into the following steps:

1. **Activation**: The input tensor `x` is passed through an activation function (`self.act(x)`). This step introduces non-linearity to the model.
2. **Feed-Forward Network**: The activated tensor is then processed by a feed-forward network (`self.ff(self.act(x))`). This typically involves one or more linear transformations and may include additional layers such as batch normalization or dropout.
3. **Residual Connection**: Finally, the output of the feed-forward network is added to the original input tensor `x`. This residual connection helps in training very deep networks by allowing gradients to flow more easily through the architecture.

## Relationship Description

The function has callers within the project, as indicated by the presence of `referencer_content` being True. However, there are no callees from other parts of the project (`reference_letter` is False). This means that `forward` is invoked by other components but does not call any other functions or modules.

## Usage Notes and Refactoring Suggestions

- **Introduce Explaining Variable**: The expression `self.ff(self.act(x))` could be assigned to an explaining variable to improve readability, especially if this expression becomes more complex in future iterations.
  
  ```python
  activated = self.act(x)
  ff_output = self.ff(activated)
  return x + ff_output
  ```

- **Encapsulate Collection**: If the feed-forward network (`self.ff`) or activation function (`self.act`) involves multiple operations, consider encapsulating these within their own methods to improve modularity and separation of concerns.

- **Extract Method**: The entire logic inside `forward` could be extracted into a separate method if it becomes more complex or is reused in other parts of the codebase. This would help maintain the Single Responsibility Principle.

By applying these refactoring suggestions, the code can become more readable, maintainable, and easier to extend for future enhancements.

- **hidden_dim**: An integer indicating the number of neurons in each hidden layer of the neural network. Default value is 256.
- **hidden_layers**: An integer specifying the number of residual blocks in both the global and local networks. Default value is 3.

### Return Values

The `forward` method returns a tensor representing the denoised output, which combines contributions from both the global and local branches based on dynamically calculated weights.

### Detailed Explanation

The `MLPDenoiser` class inherits from `nn.Module` and implements a neural network architecture for denoising tasks. The model consists of two main branches: global and local, each with its own set of layers and operations. Additionally, it includes a weight network that determines the contribution of each branch to the final output.

1. **Initialization (`__init__` method)**:
   - **Embedding Layers**: Two `SinusoidalEmbedding` layers are created for input features (`input_mlp1` and `input_mlp2`) with different scales, and one for time steps (`time_mlp`).
   - **Global Network**: A sequential network composed of a linear layer, multiple residual blocks, a ReLU activation function, and another linear layer that outputs two values.
   - **Local Network**: Similar to the global network but operates on upscaled input features.
   - **Upscale/Downscale Layers**: Linear layers used to upscale and downscale input features.
   - **Weight Network**: A sequential network that takes time embeddings as input and outputs a softmax-weighted vector of two values, ensuring the weights sum to 1.

2. **Forward Pass (`forward` method)**:
   - **Embedding Computation**: Embeddings for input features and time steps are computed using the respective embedding layers.
   - **Global Branch**: The global network processes the concatenated embeddings from input features and time steps.
   - **Local Branch**: Input features are upscaled, embedded again, and then processed by the local network.
   - **Weight Calculation**: Weights for combining global and local outputs are computed using the weight network based on time embeddings.
   - **Output Combination**: The final output is a weighted sum of the global and local outputs, where the weights are determined dynamically.

### Relationship Description

The `MLPDenoiser` class does not have any explicit references (`referencer_content` or `reference_letter`) provided in the documentation. Therefore, there is no functional relationship to describe within this project structure based on the given information.

### Usage Notes and Refactoring Suggestions

- **Complexity in Forward Method**: The forward method contains several operations that could be extracted into separate methods for better readability and modularity.
  - **Suggested Refactoring**: Extract the embedding computation, global branch processing, local branch processing, weight calculation, and output combination into separate methods. This would improve separation of concerns and make the code easier to understand and maintain.

- **Potential for Polymorphism**: If there are multiple types of denoising tasks or different architectures that could be implemented, consider using polymorphism to handle variations.
  - **Suggested Refactoring**: Introduce an abstract base class for denoisers and implement specific denoiser classes as subclasses. This would enhance flexibility and make it easier to extend the system in the future.

- **Encapsulate Collection**: If there are any internal collections or lists used within the methods, consider encapsulating them to prevent direct access.
  - **Suggested Refactoring**: Encapsulate any internal collections by defining getter and setter methods if necessary. This would protect the integrity of the data and provide controlled access.

By applying these refactoring suggestions, the `MLPDenoiser` class can be made more modular, readable, and maintainable, which will facilitate future enhancements and extensions to the system.
### FunctionDef __init__(self, embedding_dim, hidden_dim, hidden_layers)

- **hidden_layers**: An integer indicating the number of residual blocks used in the global and local networks. Defaults to 3.

# Return Values

The function does not return any value; it initializes the instance with various attributes.

# Detailed Explanation

The `__init__` function sets up several key components for the `MLPDenoiser`:

1. **Embeddings**:
   - `time_mlp`: A `SinusoidalEmbedding` layer that converts input time data into a high-dimensional embedding.
   - `input_mlp1` and `input_mlp2`: Two additional `SinusoidalEmbedding` layers, each with a scale factor of 25.0.

2. **Global Network**:
   - A sequential neural network composed of:
     - An initial linear layer that takes the concatenated embeddings as input.
     - A series of `ResidualBlock` layers, which apply residual connections to enhance training stability and speed up convergence.
     - A ReLU activation function.
     - A final linear layer that outputs two values.

3. **Local Network**:
   - Structurally identical to the global network but operates on different input data.

4. **Upscale and Downscale Layers**:
   - `upscale`: A linear layer that increases the dimensionality of the output from 2 to 4.
   - `downscale`: A linear layer that reduces the dimensionality back to 2.

5. **Weight Network**:
   - Outputs two weights using a sequential network with ReLU activation and a softmax layer to ensure the weights sum to 1.

# Relationship Description

The `__init__` function is called when an instance of the `MLPDenoiser` class is created. It does not call any other functions or classes directly but relies on several components defined in the same file, such as `SinusoidalEmbedding` and `ResidualBlock`.

# Usage Notes and Refactoring Suggestions

- **Extract Method**: The initialization of the global and local networks has a repetitive structure. Extracting this into a separate method could improve code readability and maintainability.
  
  ```python
  def _create_network(self, embedding_dim: int, hidden_dim: int, hidden_layers: int) -> nn.Sequential:
      return nn.Sequential(
          nn.Linear(embedding_dim * 3, hidden_dim),
          *[ResidualBlock(hidden_dim) for _ in range(hidden_layers)],
          nn.ReLU(),
          nn.Linear(hidden_dim, 2),
      )
  
  self.global_network = self._create_network(embedding_dim, hidden_dim, hidden_layers)
  self.local_network = self._create_network(embedding_dim, hidden_dim, hidden_layers)
  ```

- **Introduce Explaining Variable**: The expression `torch.log(torch.Tensor([10000.0])) / (half_dim - 1)` in the `SinusoidalEmbedding` class could be assigned to an explaining variable for better readability.

  ```python
  log_tensor = torch.log(torch.Tensor([10000.0]))
  emb = log_tensor / (half_dim - 1)
  ```

- **Replace Conditional with Polymorphism**: If there are different types of embedding layers that could be used, consider using polymorphism to handle them.

- **Simplify Conditional Expressions**: Ensure all conditional expressions are clear and concise. The current code does not have complex conditionals, but this is a good practice for future maintenance.

By applying these refactoring techniques, the code can become more modular, easier to read, and maintainable.

### FunctionDef forward(self, x, t)
### Function Overview

The `forward` function is a core component of the `MLPDenoiser` class within the `run_2.py` module. It processes input data and time information through multiple neural network branches to produce denoised output.

### Parameters

- **x**: A tensor representing the input data, expected to have two channels (e.g., x[:, 0] and x[:, 1]).
- **t**: A tensor representing time-related information.

### Return Values

The function returns a tensor `output`, which is the denoised result combining outputs from both global and local branches with dynamic weights determined by the timestep.

### Detailed Explanation

The `forward` function processes input data through two main branches: a global branch and a local branch. Each branch involves multiple steps of embedding, network processing, and combination.

1. **Embedding**:
   - The input tensor `x` is split into two channels (`x[:, 0]` and `x[:, 1]`) and passed through separate MLPs (`input_mlp1` and `input_mlp2`). These embeddings are then concatenated with an embedding of the time tensor `t`, which has been processed by `time_mlp`.
   
2. **Global Branch**:
   - The combined embedding from the previous step is fed into a global network (`global_network`) to generate the global output.
   
3. **Local Branch with Upscaling**:
   - The input data `x` is upscaled using an upscale method, and the resulting tensor is again split into two channels. These are embedded using the same MLPs as in the global branch, concatenated with the time embedding, and processed by a local network (`local_network`) to generate the local output.
   
4. **Dynamic Weights**:
   - The weights for combining the global and local outputs are determined by a weight network (`weight_network`), which takes the time embedding `t_emb` as input.
   
5. **Output Combination**:
   - The final output is calculated by combining the global and local outputs using the dynamic weights. This is done by multiplying each branch's output with its corresponding weight and summing them up.

### Relationship Description

The `forward` function does not have any explicit references (`referencer_content` or `reference_letter`) within the provided project structure. Therefore, there is no functional relationship to describe in terms of callers or callees.

### Usage Notes and Refactoring Suggestions

- **Extract Method**: The embedding process for both global and local branches could be refactored into a separate method to avoid code duplication.
  
  ```python
  def _embed_input(self, x):
      x1_emb = self.input_mlp1(x[:, 0])
      x2_emb = self.input_mlp2(x[:, 1])
      return torch.cat([x1_emb, x2_emb], dim=-1)
  ```

- **Introduce Explaining Variable**: The combined embedding of global and local branches could be stored in an explaining variable to improve code clarity.
  
  ```python
  global_emb = self._embed_input(x) + t_emb
  local_emb = self._embed_input(x_upscaled) + t_emb
  ```

- **Simplify Conditional Expressions**: If the weight network's output is used elsewhere, consider using guard clauses to simplify conditional expressions related to weights.

By applying these refactoring suggestions, the code can become more modular, easier to read, and maintain.
***
## ClassDef NoiseScheduler
**Function Overview**: The `NoiseScheduler` class is designed to manage and compute noise schedules for denoising processes, particularly useful in generative models like diffusion models. It calculates various parameters related to noise levels over a specified number of timesteps.

**Parameters**:
- **num_timesteps (int)**: The total number of timesteps for the noise schedule. Default is 1000.
- **beta_start (float)**: The starting value of beta in the noise schedule. Default is 0.0001.
- **beta_end (float)**: The ending value of beta in the noise schedule. Default is 0.02.
- **beta_schedule (str)**: The type of schedule for beta values, either "linear" or "quadratic". Default is "linear".

**Return Values**: None

**Detailed Explanation**:
The `NoiseScheduler` class initializes with parameters defining the number of timesteps and the range of beta values. It computes various noise-related parameters such as alphas, cumulative products of alphas, and coefficients for posterior calculations. These parameters are essential for adding noise to data (`add_noise`) and reconstructing original samples from noisy ones (`reconstruct_x0`). The class also includes methods to compute the variance at a given timestep (`get_variance`), perform a step in the denoising process (`step`), and calculate the mean of the posterior distribution (`q_posterior`).

The logic flow involves:
1. Initializing beta values based on the specified schedule.
2. Calculating alphas and their cumulative products, which are used to derive other parameters.
3. Preparing coefficients for posterior calculations to facilitate denoising steps.
4. Providing methods to add noise to data, reconstruct original samples from noisy ones, compute variance, perform denoising steps, and calculate posterior means.

**Relationship Description**: The `NoiseScheduler` class is likely a core component in the diffusion model framework within the project. It may be referenced by other classes or functions that require noise scheduling for their operations. There are no specific references provided to indicate callees or callers, so the exact relationships within the project remain unclear based on the given information.

**Usage Notes and Refactoring Suggestions**:
- **Simplify Conditional Expressions**: The conditional logic in the constructor could be simplified by using guard clauses to handle different beta schedules.
  ```python
  if beta_schedule == "linear":
      self.betas = np.linspace(beta_start, beta_end, num_timesteps)
  elif beta_schedule == "quadratic":
      self.betas = np.linspace(np.sqrt(beta_start), np.sqrt(beta_end), num_timesteps) ** 2
  else:
      raise ValueError("Invalid beta schedule")
  ```
- **Encapsulate Collection**: The internal collection of beta values could be encapsulated within a private method to hide its implementation details.
  ```python
  def _initialize_betas(self, beta_start, beta_end, num_timesteps, beta_schedule):
      if beta_schedule == "linear":
          return np.linspace(beta_start, beta_end, num_timesteps)
      elif beta_schedule == "quadratic":
          return np.linspace(np.sqrt(beta_start), np.sqrt(beta_end), num_timesteps) ** 2
      else:
          raise ValueError("Invalid beta schedule")
  ```
- **Extract Method**: The computation of alphas and their cumulative products could be extracted into separate methods to improve readability.
  ```python
  def _compute_alphas(self):
      return 1 - self.betas

  def _compute_cumulative_alphas(self):
      return np.cumprod(self.alphas)
  ```
- **Introduce Explaining Variable**: For complex expressions, introduce explaining variables to enhance clarity. For example:
  ```python
  cumulative_alpha_t = self.cumulative_alphas[t]
  variance_t = (1 - cumulative_alpha_t) / (1 - self.alphas_bar[t])
  ```

These refactoring suggestions aim to improve the readability and maintainability of the `NoiseScheduler` class, making it easier to understand and modify in the future.

It calculates various coefficients and cumulative products that are essential for adding noise to data (`add_noise`) and reconstructing original data from noisy samples (`reconstruct_x0`). The method supports two types of beta schedules: linear and quadratic.

1. **Beta Calculation**:
   - If the schedule is "linear", betas are evenly spaced between `beta_start` and `beta_end`.
   - If the schedule is "quadratic", betas are squared after being evenly spaced between the square roots of `beta_start` and `beta_end`.

2. **Alpha Calculation**:
   - Alphas are calculated as 1 minus each beta value.

3. **Cumulative Products**:
   - `alphas_cumprod`: Cumulative product of alphas.
   - `alphas_cumprod_prev`: Padded cumulative product of alphas, with an initial value of 1.

4. **Square Roots and Inverses**:
   - Various square roots and inverses of cumulative products are calculated to support different operations in the diffusion model.

5. **Posterior Mean Coefficients**:
   - These coefficients are used for calculating the mean of the posterior distribution during inference.

### Relationship Description

The `__init__` method is called when a new instance of the `NoiseScheduler` class is created. It initializes all necessary parameters and pre-calculated values that other methods within the `NoiseScheduler` class rely on. There are no references to this component from other parts of the project, indicating it does not have any callees.

### Usage Notes and Refactoring Suggestions

- **Extract Method**: The method could be refactored by extracting the beta calculation into a separate method (`calculate_betas`) to improve readability and modularity.
  
  ```python
  def calculate_betas(self, num_timesteps, beta_start, beta_end, beta_schedule):
      if beta_schedule == "linear":
          return torch.linspace(beta_start, beta_end, num_timesteps, dtype=torch.float32).to(device)
      elif beta_schedule == "quadratic":
          betas = torch.linspace(beta_start ** 0.5, beta_end ** 0.5, num_timesteps, dtype=torch.float32) ** 2
          return betas.to(device)
      else:
          raise ValueError(f"Unknown beta schedule: {beta_schedule}")
  
  def __init__(self, num_timesteps=1000, beta_start=0.0001, beta_end=0.02, beta_schedule="linear"):
      self.num_timesteps = num_timesteps
      self.betas = self.calculate_betas(num_timesteps, beta_start, beta_end, beta_schedule)
      # ... rest of the initialization code ...
  ```

- **Introduce Explaining Variable**: Introducing explaining variables for complex expressions can improve readability. For example, using a variable to store `1 - self.alphas_cumprod` before calculating its square root.

  ```python
  one_minus_alphas_cumprod = 1 - self.alphas_cumprod
  self.sqrt_one_minus_alphas_cumprod = torch.sqrt(one_minus_alphas_cumprod).to(device)
  ```

- **Simplify Conditional Expressions**: The conditional expression for `beta_schedule` can be simplified by using guard clauses.

  ```python
  if beta_schedule == "linear":
      self.betas = torch.linspace(beta_start, beta_end, num_timesteps, dtype=torch.float32).to(device)
  elif beta_schedule == "quadratic":
      betas = torch.linspace(beta_start ** 0.5, beta_end ** 0.5, num_timesteps, dtype=torch.float32) ** 2
      self.betas = betas.to(device)
  else:
      raise ValueError(f"Unknown beta schedule: {beta_schedule}")
  ```

### FunctionDef reconstruct_x0(self, x_t, t, noise)
## Function Overview

The `reconstruct_x0` function is designed to reconstruct the original sample \( x_0 \) from a given noisy sample \( x_t \), noise, and the current timestep \( t \).

## Parameters

- **x_t**: The noisy sample at the current timestep.
  - Type: Tensor
  - Description: Represents the noisy version of the original sample at time step \( t \).
  
- **t**: The current timestep.
  - Type: Integer or Tensor
  - Description: Indicates the current position in the diffusion process.

- **noise**: The noise added to the original sample.
  - Type: Tensor
  - Description: Represents the noise component that was added to the original sample to produce \( x_t \).

## Return Values

- Returns a reconstructed version of the original sample \( x_0 \).
  - Type: Tensor
  - Description: The tensor representing the estimated original sample before any noise was added.

## Detailed Explanation

The `reconstruct_x0` function calculates an estimate of the original sample \( x_0 \) using the following steps:

1. **Retrieve Scaling Factors**: 
   - `s1 = self.sqrt_inv_alphas_cumprod[t]`: Retrieves the square root of the inverse cumulative product of alphas at timestep \( t \).
   - `s2 = self.sqrt_inv_alphas_cumprod_minus_one[t]`: Retrieves the square root of the inverse cumulative product of alphas minus one at timestep \( t \).

2. **Reshape Scaling Factors**:
   - `s1 = s1.reshape(-1, 1)`: Reshapes `s1` to ensure it is compatible with tensor operations.
   - `s2 = s2.reshape(-1, 1)`: Similarly reshapes `s2`.

3. **Reconstruct \( x_0 \)**:
   - The function returns the reconstructed sample \( x_0 \) using the formula: 
     \[
     x_0 = s1 \times x_t - s2 \times noise
     \]
   This formula leverages the scaling factors to reverse the diffusion process and estimate the original sample.

## Relationship Description

- **Callers**: The `reconstruct_x0` function is called by the `step` method within the same class (`NoiseScheduler`). The `step` method uses the reconstructed \( x_0 \) to calculate the previous sample in the diffusion process.
  
- **Callees**: This function does not call any other functions or methods internally.

## Usage Notes and Refactoring Suggestions

- **Introduce Explaining Variable**:
  - The expression `s1 * x_t - s2 * noise` could be simplified by introducing an explaining variable for clarity. For example:
    ```python
    scaled_x_t = s1 * x_t
    scaled_noise = s2 * noise
    reconstructed_x0 = scaled_x_t - scaled_noise
    return reconstructed_x0
    ```
  This would make the code more readable and easier to understand.

- **Encapsulate Collection**:
  - If `self.sqrt_inv_alphas_cumprod` and `self.sqrt_inv_alphas_cumprod_minus_one` are large collections, consider encapsulating them within a class or using a helper function to manage access. This could improve maintainability and reduce the risk of errors when accessing these collections.

- **Simplify Conditional Expressions**:
  - Although not directly applicable in this function, ensure that any conditional logic (if statements) is simplified using guard clauses for improved readability and maintainability.

By applying these refactoring suggestions, the code can be made more readable, maintainable, and easier to understand.

### FunctionDef q_posterior(self, x_0, x_t, t)
# Function Overview

The `q_posterior` function computes the posterior mean of a sample given its original sample (`x_0`) and noisy sample (`x_t`) at a specific timestep (`t`). This calculation is crucial for denoising processes within the adaptive dual scale denoising framework.

# Parameters

- **x_0**: The original, noise-free sample. It serves as the base reference for computing the posterior mean.
  
- **x_t**: The noisy sample at the current timestep `t`. This represents the corrupted version of the original sample that needs to be denoised.

- **t**: The timestep at which the samples are considered. This parameter is used to index into the noise scheduler's coefficients, which vary with time.

# Return Values

The function returns a tensor (`mu`), representing the computed posterior mean of the sample. This value is a weighted sum of the original sample and the noisy sample, adjusted by coefficients derived from the noise schedule at the given timestep.

# Detailed Explanation

The `q_posterior` function calculates the posterior mean using the following steps:

1. **Retrieve Coefficients**: The function accesses two coefficients (`s1` and `s2`) from the noise scheduler's configuration for the given timestep `t`. These coefficients are used to weight the original sample (`x_0`) and the noisy sample (`x_t`).

2. **Reshape Coefficients**: Both coefficients are reshaped to ensure they can be broadcasted correctly against the dimensions of the input samples.

3. **Compute Posterior Mean**: The posterior mean is computed as a linear combination of `x_0` and `x_t`, weighted by `s1` and `s2`, respectively. This step effectively blends the original and noisy samples based on the noise schedule's configuration.

4. **Return Result**: The resulting tensor (`mu`) is returned, representing the posterior mean at the specified timestep.

# Relationship Description

The `q_posterior` function is called by the `step` method within the same class (`NoiseScheduler`). This relationship indicates that `q_posterior` plays a role in the iterative denoising process, where it computes the previous sample estimate based on the current noisy sample and its original counterpart.

# Usage Notes and Refactoring Suggestions

- **Extract Method**: The reshaping of coefficients could be extracted into a separate method if this operation is reused elsewhere. This would improve code modularity and readability.
  
- **Introduce Explaining Variable**: The expression for computing `mu` could benefit from an explaining variable to break down the calculation into more understandable parts, especially if the formula becomes more complex in future modifications.

- **Encapsulate Collection**: If the coefficients (`posterior_mean_coef1` and `posterior_mean_coef2`) are accessed frequently, encapsulating them within a dedicated method or property could enhance code organization and reduce direct access to internal collections.

By applying these refactoring techniques, the function can be made more maintainable and easier to understand, while also improving its flexibility for future enhancements.

### FunctionDef get_variance(self, t)
---

**Function Overview**: The `get_variance` function calculates and returns the variance at a given timestep `t`, which is used in noise scheduling processes within denoising algorithms.

**Parameters**:
- **t**: An integer representing the current timestep. This parameter determines the point in the diffusion process where the variance needs to be calculated.

**Return Values**:
- A float value representing the variance at the specified timestep `t`. The variance is clipped to a minimum of 1e-20 to avoid numerical instability.

**Detailed Explanation**:
The `get_variance` function computes the variance for a given timestep `t` using the following steps:

1. **Initial Check**: If `t` is 0, the function immediately returns 0 as there is no variance at the initial step of the diffusion process.
2. **Variance Calculation**: For timesteps greater than 0, the variance is calculated using the formula:
   \[
   \text{variance} = \frac{\beta_t (1 - \alpha_{\text{cumprod}}^{\text{prev}}[t])}{1 - \alpha_{\text{cumprod}}[t]}
   \]
   Here, `self.betas[t]` represents the noise schedule at timestep `t`, and `self.alphas_cumprod_prev[t]` and `self.alphas_cumprod[t]` are cumulative products of alpha values up to the previous and current timesteps, respectively.
3. **Clipping**: The calculated variance is then clipped to a minimum value of 1e-20 to prevent underflow issues during computations.

**Relationship Description**:
The `get_variance` function is called by the `step` method within the same class (`NoiseScheduler`). This relationship indicates that `get_variance` serves as a utility function for computing variance, which is essential for generating noise at each timestep in the denoising process. The `step` method uses this variance to add noise to the predicted previous sample, ensuring that the diffusion process remains stable and effective.

**Usage Notes and Refactoring Suggestions**:
- **Clipping Value**: The clipping value of 1e-20 is hardcoded. Consider making it a configurable parameter to allow for more flexibility in different denoising scenarios.
- **Formula Clarity**: The variance calculation formula could be extracted into its own method if the function grows more complex or needs to be reused elsewhere, adhering to the **Extract Method** refactoring technique.
- **Edge Cases**: Ensure that `self.betas`, `self.alphas_cumprod_prev`, and `self.alphas_cumprod` are properly initialized and have valid values for all timesteps to avoid unexpected behavior.

### FunctionDef add_noise(self, x_start, x_noise, timesteps)
### Function Overview

The `add_noise` function is designed to add noise to a starting signal (`x_start`) by combining it with a noise signal (`x_noise`) using specific scaling factors derived from cumulative product arrays at given timesteps.

### Parameters

- **x_start**: The original signal or data array that needs noise added.
- **x_noise**: The noise signal to be added to the original signal.
- **timesteps**: An index or list of indices indicating the time steps for which the noise should be scaled and added.

### Return Values

The function returns a new array representing the original signal with added noise, calculated as `s1 * x_start + s2 * x_noise`.

### Detailed Explanation

The `add_noise` function operates by scaling two input arrays (`x_start` and `x_noise`) using factors derived from cumulative product arrays (`sqrt_alphas_cumprod` and `sqrt_one_minus_alphas_cumprod`). These factors are determined based on the provided timesteps. The function reshapes these factors to ensure they can be broadcasted correctly against the input arrays, then combines them to produce the final noisy signal.

### Relationship Description

There is no functional relationship described for this component as neither `referencer_content` nor `reference_letter` parameters are present and truthy.

### Usage Notes and Refactoring Suggestions

- **Introduce Explaining Variable**: The calculation of `s1` and `s2` could be extracted into separate variables to improve readability. For example:
  ```python
  s1 = self.sqrt_alphas_cumprod[timesteps].reshape(-1, 1)
  s2 = self.sqrt_one_minus_alphas_cumprod[timesteps].reshape(-1, 1)
  noisy_signal = s1 * x_start + s2 * x_noise
  return noisy_signal
  ```
- **Encapsulate Collection**: If `sqrt_alphas_cumprod` and `sqrt_one_minus_alphas_cumprod` are large or complex collections, consider encapsulating them within a class to manage their access and manipulation more effectively.
- **Simplify Conditional Expressions**: Ensure that the input parameters (`x_start`, `x_noise`, `timesteps`) are validated before processing. For example:
  ```python
  if not isinstance(x_start, np.ndarray) or not isinstance(x_noise, np.ndarray):
      raise ValueError("Both x_start and x_noise must be numpy arrays.")
  if not isinstance(timesteps, (int, list)):
      raise ValueError("timesteps must be an integer or a list of integers.")
  ```

These suggestions aim to enhance the clarity, maintainability, and robustness of the `add_noise` function.

### FunctionDef __len__(self)
**Function Overview**: The `__len__` function returns the number of timesteps associated with the NoiseScheduler instance.

**Parameters**:
- **referencer_content**: This parameter is not applicable as there are no references (callers) from other components within the project to this component.
- **reference_letter**: This parameter is not applicable as there is no reference to this component from other project parts, representing callees in the relationship.

**Return Values**:
- The function returns an integer value representing the number of timesteps (`self.num_timesteps`).

**Detailed Explanation**:
The `__len__` method is a special method in Python that allows an object to define its length, which can be accessed using the built-in `len()` function. In this context, the method simply returns the value of `self.num_timesteps`, which presumably represents the number of timesteps associated with the NoiseScheduler instance.

**Relationship Description**:
There is no functional relationship to describe as neither `referencer_content` nor `reference_letter` are truthy. This indicates that the `__len__` method is not called by any other components within the project and does not call any other methods or functions itself.

**Usage Notes and Refactoring Suggestions**:
- The function is straightforward and does not require refactoring based on the provided code snippet.
- Ensure that `self.num_timesteps` is correctly initialized and updated throughout the lifecycle of the NoiseScheduler instance to maintain accurate length representation.
