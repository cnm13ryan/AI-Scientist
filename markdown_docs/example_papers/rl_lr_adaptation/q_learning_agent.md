### FunctionDef __init__(self, lr, gamma, epsilon)
### Function Overview

The `__init__` function initializes a new instance of the QLearningAgent class with specified learning rate (`lr`), discount factor (`gamma`), and exploration rate (`epsilon`). It sets up essential parameters and initializes an empty Q-table for state-action value storage.

### Parameters

- **lr** (float): The learning rate, which determines the extent to which newly acquired information overrides old information. Default is 0.1.
- **gamma** (float): The discount factor, used to determine the present value of future rewards. Default is 0.95.
- **epsilon** (float): The exploration rate, representing the probability of selecting a random action rather than exploiting the learned values. Default is 0.1.

### Return Values

The function does not return any value; it initializes instance variables within the QLearningAgent class.

### Detailed Explanation

The `__init__` method sets up the initial configuration for an instance of the QLearningAgent. It assigns the provided learning rate (`lr`), discount factor (`gamma`), and exploration rate (`epsilon`) to their respective instance variables. Additionally, it stores the initial value of `epsilon` in `initial_epsilon` and sets a default decay rate for `epsilon` (`epsilon_decay`). An empty dictionary `q_table` is initialized to store state-action values.

### Relationship Description

There are no references provided for this component, indicating that there is no functional relationship to describe. The `__init__` method is called when creating an instance of the QLearningAgent class and does not call or reference any other components within the project.

### Usage Notes and Refactoring Suggestions

- **Encapsulate Collection**: The `q_table` dictionary is directly exposed as a public attribute. Consider encapsulating it by providing getter and setter methods to control access and modification, enhancing data integrity.
  
  ```python
  def get_q_table(self):
      return self._q_table
  
  def set_q_table(self, q_table):
      self._q_table = q_table
  ```

- **Introduce Explaining Variable**: The decay rate for `epsilon` is hardcoded as 0.99. If this value needs to be adjusted or used in multiple places, consider introducing an explaining variable to make it more configurable and easier to manage.

  ```python
  EPSILON_DECAY_RATE = 0.99
  self.epsilon_decay = EPSILON_DECAY_RATE
  ```

- **Simplify Conditional Expressions**: If there are conditional checks or logic based on the `epsilon` value, consider using guard clauses to simplify and improve readability.

By applying these refactoring suggestions, the code can become more modular, maintainable, and easier to understand.
