**Description**:
The target object represents an inventory item with properties that include a unique identifier (`id`), the name of the item (`name`), its price (`price`), and availability status (`in_stock`). Each property is defined by its type, which specifies the kind of data it holds, and a description that clarifies its purpose within the context of the inventory system. The object requires all four properties to be present for a complete representation of an item.

## FunctionDef on_backoff(details)
### Function Overview

The `on_backoff` function is designed to log information about a backoff event that occurs when a function call fails and needs to be retried after a specified wait time.

### Parameters

- **details**: A dictionary containing information about the backoff event. The dictionary includes:
  - `'wait'`: The number of seconds the system will wait before retrying the function.
  - `'tries'`: The number of attempts that have been made to call the function so far.
  - `'target'`: The function object that is being retried.

### Return Values

- **None**: The function does not return any value; it only prints a log message.

### Detailed Explanation

The `on_backoff` function logs details about a backoff event. It takes a dictionary named `details` as its parameter, which contains information about the wait time (`'wait'`), the number of tries (`'tries'`), and the target function (`'target'`). The function constructs a log message that includes these details and prints it to the console.

The log message provides the following information:
- The amount of time (in seconds) the system will wait before retrying the function.
- The number of attempts that have been made so far.
- The name of the target function that is being retried.
- The current time in a human-readable format (`'%X'`).

### Relationship Description

There is no functional relationship to describe as there are no references provided for `referencer_content` or `reference_letter`.

### Usage Notes and Refactoring Suggestions

- **Extract Method**: The logging logic could be extracted into a separate method if the function grows more complex or if similar logging needs to be performed in other parts of the project.
  
  ```python
  def log_backoff(details):
      print(
          f"Backing off {details['wait']:0.1f} seconds after {details['tries']} tries "
          f"calling function {details['target'].__name__} at {time.strftime('%X')}"
      )

  def on_backoff(details):
      log_backoff(details)
  ```

- **Introduce Explaining Variable**: If the dictionary keys or formatting strings become complex, consider introducing explaining variables to improve readability.

  ```python
  wait_time = details['wait']
  number_of_tries = details['tries']
  function_name = details['target'].__name__
  current_time = time.strftime('%X')
  
  print(f"Backing off {wait_time:0.1f} seconds after {number_of_tries} tries calling function {function_name} at {current_time}")
  ```

- **Simplify Conditional Expressions**: If additional conditions or logic are added to the function, consider using guard clauses to simplify conditional expressions and improve readability.

By applying these refactoring techniques, the code can become more modular, maintainable, and easier to understand.

**Description**:
The provided JSON schema defines an object that represents a product or service. This object includes several properties, each serving a specific purpose in describing the item:

- **name**: A string that specifies the name of the product or service.
- **price**: A number representing the price of the product or service in US dollars.
- **category**: A string indicating the category to which the product or service belongs. This helps in organizing and searching for similar items.
- **features**: An array of strings, where each string represents a feature of the product or service. This property provides detailed information about what the item offers.
- **availability**: A boolean value that indicates whether the product or service is currently available for purchase.

The schema specifies that the `name`, `price`, and `category` properties are required, ensuring that every instance of this object includes these essential details. The `additionalProperties` field is set to false, meaning that no other properties can be added beyond those explicitly defined in the schema. This helps maintain consistency and predictability in how product or service objects are structured.
