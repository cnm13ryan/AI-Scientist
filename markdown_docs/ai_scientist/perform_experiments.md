## FunctionDef run_experiment(folder_name, run_num, timeout)
---

### Function Overview

The `run_experiment` function is designed to execute a specified experiment script within a designated folder and handle its output, errors, and timeouts.

### Parameters

- **folder_name** (str): The absolute path to the directory containing the experiment script (`experiment.py`) and where the results will be stored.
- **run_num** (int): An identifier for the current run of the experiment, used to create a unique output directory (`run_{run_num}`).
- **timeout** (int, optional): The maximum time in seconds that the experiment is allowed to run before it is terminated. Defaults to 7200 seconds (2 hours).

### Return Values

The function returns two values:
1. **return_code** (int): The exit status of the experiment script. A value of `0` indicates successful execution, while any other value indicates an error.
2. **next_prompt** (str): A string that provides instructions or feedback for the next steps in the experimental process.

### Detailed Explanation

The `run_experiment` function performs the following operations:
1. **Copy Experiment Script**: Copies the `experiment.py` script to a new file named `run_{run_num}.py` within the specified folder.
2. **Launch Command**: Constructs and executes a command to run the copied experiment script with the output directory set to `run_{run_num}`.
3. **Handle Execution Result**:
   - If the execution is successful (`return_code == 0`), it reads the results from `final_info.json` in the output directory, processes them, and generates a prompt for further actions.
   - If the execution fails (non-zero return code or timeout), it captures the error message and generates an appropriate prompt to address the issue.
4. **Return Values**: The function returns the exit status of the experiment script and a string that guides the next steps in the experimental workflow.

### Relationship Description

- **Callers**: The `run_experiment` function is called by the `perform_experiments` function within the same module. This relationship indicates that `run_experiment` is part of a larger process responsible for executing multiple experiments.
  
  ```python
  # Example caller code snippet
  def perform_experiments(experiment_folder, num_runs):
      results = []
      for i in range(num_runs):
          return_code, prompt = run_experiment(experiment_folder, i + 1)
          results.append((return_code, prompt))
      return results
  ```

- **Callees**: The function does not call any other functions within the provided code snippet. It relies on external tools and scripts (`experiment.py`) to perform the actual experiment.

### Usage Notes and Refactoring Suggestions

- **Error Handling**: The current error handling is basic, focusing solely on non-zero return codes and timeouts. Consider enhancing this by capturing specific exceptions or errors that may occur during execution.
  
  ```python
  # Example of enhanced error handling
  try:
      result = subprocess.run(command, check=True, timeout=timeout)
  except subprocess.CalledProcessError as e:
      next_prompt = f"Experiment failed with return code {e.returncode}. Please review the logs."
  except subprocess.TimeoutExpired:
      next_prompt = "Experiment timed out. Consider increasing the timeout value or optimizing the experiment."
  ```

- **Code Duplication**: If similar logic is used in other parts of the project, consider extracting common functionality into separate functions to reduce duplication and improve maintainability.
  
  ```python
  # Example of Extract Method refactoring
  def generate_next_prompt(return_code, error_message=None):
      if return_code == 0:
          results = read_results_from_file(output_dir)
          return f"Experiment succeeded. Results: {results}"
      else:
          return f"Experiment failed with message: {error_message}"
  ```

- **Modularity**: The function could be further modularized by separating the copying of files, command execution, and result processing into distinct functions.
  
  ```python
  # Example of Encapsulate Collection refactoring
  def copy_experiment_script(source_path, destination_path):
      shutil.copy(source_path, destination_path)

  def execute_command(command, timeout):
      return subprocess.run(command, check=True, timeout=timeout)
  ```

By addressing these areas, the `run_experiment` function can become more robust, maintainable, and easier to extend for future requirements.
## FunctionDef run_plotting(folder_name, timeout)
## Function Overview

The `run_plotting` function is designed to execute a plotting script (`plot.py`) within a specified directory and handle its output, including errors and timeouts.

## Parameters

- **folder_name**: A string representing the absolute path of the directory where `plot.py` is located. This parameter specifies the working directory for the subprocess execution.
  
- **timeout** (optional): An integer specifying the maximum number of seconds to wait for the plotting script to complete before timing out. The default value is 600 seconds.

## Return Values

The function returns a tuple containing two elements:

1. **return_code**: An integer representing the exit status of the `plot.py` subprocess. A return code of 0 indicates successful execution, while any other value signifies an error.
  
2. **next_prompt**: A string that provides feedback or instructions for subsequent actions based on the outcome of the plotting script execution.

## Detailed Explanation

The `run_plotting` function is responsible for executing the `plot.py` script within a specified directory (`folder_name`). The function constructs a command to run this script using Python's `subprocess.run` method. Hereâ€™s a step-by-step breakdown of its logic:

1. **Set Working Directory**: The current working directory (`cwd`) is set to the absolute path provided by `folder_name`.

2. **Construct Command**: A command list is created to execute `plot.py` using Python.

3. **Execute Subprocess**: The `subprocess.run` method is used to run the constructed command within the specified working directory. The function captures both standard output and standard error, and sets a timeout for the subprocess execution.

4. **Handle Errors**:
   - If there is any content in `stderr`, it indicates an error during script execution. This error message is printed to `sys.stderr`.
   - If the return code of the subprocess is not 0, it signifies that the plotting failed. The function constructs a feedback string (`next_prompt`) indicating the failure and the associated error message.
   
5. **Handle Timeout**: If the subprocess execution exceeds the specified timeout, a `TimeoutExpired` exception is caught. The function prints a timeout message to `sys.stderr` and sets the return code to 1.

6. **Return Results**: The function returns a tuple containing the return code and the feedback string (`next_prompt`).

## Relationship Description

- **referencer_content**: True
- **reference_letter**: False

The `run_plotting` function is called by the `perform_experiments` function within the same module (`perform_experiments.py`). This relationship indicates that `run_plotting` is a callee of `perform_experiments`.

## Usage Notes and Refactoring Suggestions

### Limitations and Edge Cases
- **Timeout Handling**: The current implementation handles timeouts but does not provide any additional retry mechanisms or alternative strategies for handling long-running plotting tasks.
- **Error Handling**: While the function captures and prints errors, it could be enhanced to log these errors more robustly, especially if this script is part of a larger system where error tracking is crucial.

### Refactoring Opportunities
1. **Extract Method**:
   - The error handling logic (printing `stderr` and constructing feedback strings) can be extracted into separate methods for better readability and reusability.
   
2. **Introduce Explaining Variable**:
   - Introducing variables to store intermediate results, such as the constructed command or the timeout message, could improve code clarity.

3. **Simplify Conditional Expressions**:
   - Using guard clauses to handle errors and timeouts early in the function can simplify the main execution flow and make the code easier to follow.

4. **Encapsulate Collection**:
   - If there are multiple subprocess-related operations or configurations, encapsulating them into a separate class could improve modularity and maintainability.

By applying these refactoring techniques, the `run_plotting` function can be made more readable, modular, and robust, enhancing its maintainability for future changes.
