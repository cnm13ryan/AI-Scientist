## FunctionDef generate_color_palette(n)
### Function Overview

The `generate_color_palette` function is designed to generate a list of hexadecimal color codes based on the 'tab20' colormap provided by Matplotlib.

### Parameters

- **n**: An integer representing the number of colors to be generated in the palette. This parameter determines how many distinct colors will be extracted from the 'tab20' colormap.

### Return Values

The function returns a list of strings, where each string is a hexadecimal color code (e.g., '#1f77b4').

### Detailed Explanation

The `generate_color_palette` function leverages Matplotlib's colormap functionality to generate a set of colors. Hereâ€™s a breakdown of the logic:

1. **Colormap Selection**: The function uses `plt.get_cmap('tab20')` to select the 'tab20' colormap, which is a predefined colormap in Matplotlib that includes 20 distinct colors.

2. **Color Extraction**: The function then generates `n` evenly spaced values between 0 and 1 using `np.linspace(0, 1, n)`. These values are used to index into the 'tab20' colormap.

3. **Hexadecimal Conversion**: For each value obtained from the previous step, the function uses `cmap(i)` to get the corresponding RGB color tuple. The `mcolors.rgb2hex` function is then used to convert this RGB tuple into a hexadecimal color code.

4. **List Construction**: The resulting list of hexadecimal color codes is returned by the function.

### Relationship Description

There are no references provided (`referencer_content` and `reference_letter` are both falsy). Therefore, there is no functional relationship to describe within the project structure.

### Usage Notes and Refactoring Suggestions

- **Limitations**: The function assumes that the 'tab20' colormap has at least `n` distinct colors. If `n` exceeds 20, the function will still return a list of 20 colors repeated.
  
- **Edge Cases**: 
  - If `n` is less than or equal to 0, the function will return an empty list.
  - If `n` is greater than 20, the function will only return the first 20 unique colors from the 'tab20' colormap.

- **Refactoring Opportunities**:
  - **Introduce Explaining Variable**: The expression `np.linspace(0, 1, n)` could be assigned to an explaining variable to improve readability.
  
    ```python
    color_indices = np.linspace(0, 1, n)
    return [mcolors.rgb2hex(cmap(i)) for i in color_indices]
    ```
  
  - **Encapsulate Collection**: If the function is part of a larger class or module that manages multiple colormaps, consider encapsulating the colormap selection and conversion logic within a method to improve modularity.

By addressing these refactoring suggestions, the code can become more readable and maintainable.
