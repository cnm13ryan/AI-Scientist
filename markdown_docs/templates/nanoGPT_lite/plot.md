## FunctionDef generate_color_palette(n)
**Function Overview**: The `generate_color_palette` function generates a list of hexadecimal color codes based on the 'tab20' colormap from Matplotlib.

**Parameters**:
- **n**: An integer representing the number of colors to generate. This parameter determines how many distinct colors will be included in the returned palette.

**Return Values**:
- A list of strings, where each string is a hexadecimal color code (e.g., '#1f77b4').

**Detailed Explanation**:
The `generate_color_palette` function leverages Matplotlib's colormap functionality to generate a specified number of colors. It uses the 'tab20' colormap, which provides 20 distinct colors suitable for visual differentiation in plots and charts. The function works as follows:

1. **Retrieve Colormap**: It fetches the 'tab20' colormap using `plt.get_cmap('tab20')`.
2. **Generate Color Indices**: It creates an array of indices from 0 to 1 using `np.linspace(0, 1, n)`. These indices represent positions along the colormap.
3. **Convert Colors to Hexadecimal**: For each index, it retrieves the corresponding color from the colormap and converts it to a hexadecimal string using `mcolors.rgb2hex(cmap(i))`.
4. **Return Palette**: It returns a list of these hexadecimal color codes.

**Relationship Description**:
- There is no functional relationship described for this function based on the provided information.

**Usage Notes and Refactoring Suggestions**:
- **Limitations**: The function assumes that the 'tab20' colormap is available, which might not be the case if Matplotlib is not installed or configured correctly.
- **Edge Cases**: If `n` is less than 1, the function will return an empty list. If `n` exceeds 20, it will still generate a palette of 20 colors, as 'tab20' only provides 20 distinct colors.
- **Refactoring Opportunities**:
  - **Introduce Explaining Variable**: The expression `np.linspace(0, 1, n)` could be assigned to an explaining variable to improve readability. For example:
    ```python
    indices = np.linspace(0, 1, n)
    return [mcolors.rgb2hex(cmap(i)) for i in indices]
    ```
  - **Encapsulate Collection**: If the function is part of a larger class or module that deals with color palettes, consider encapsulating the colormap and conversion logic within a method to improve modularity.
  - **Replace Conditional with Polymorphism**: This refactoring technique is not applicable here as there are no conditionals based on types.

These suggestions aim to enhance the readability and maintainability of the code while ensuring it remains functional.
